Grab a coffee and let\u2019s talk about something that always blows my mind: *how much we all have in common, even when we look nothing alike*. I was scrolling through wildlife photos the other night and realized that a jellyfish and I are basically running the same basic software\u2014just with different packaging. So here\u2019s a laid-back tour of five \u201cwait, we do that too?!\u201d moments across the animal kingdom.\n\n*We all need our beauty sleep*  \nTurns out, every animal with a nervous system\u2014from fruit flies to blue whales\u2014shares a version of sleep. Crows nap on tree branches, octopuses snooze in coconut-shell beds, and even roundworms have \u201clethargus,\u201d which is basically worm REM. Scientists think sleep is so ancient that the last common ancestor of all animals already had it. So next time you hit snooze, remember you\u2019re honoring a 700-million-year-old tradition.\n\n*Love songs come in many dialects*  \nWhether you\u2019re a human humming in the shower or a humpback whale belting out 30-minute ballads, *we all use rhythm and pitch to flirt and bond*. Frogs croak in choruses, nightingales remix their playlists nightly, and male mice sing ultrasonic \u201cpickup lines\u201d too high for us to hear. Same goal, different instruments.\n\n*Grandma knew best: family matters*  \nElephants babysit their nieces, wolves bring back take-out for auntie, and *clownfish dads are the ultimate stay-at-home fathers*. Across species, kinship networks boost survival. Even bacteria split into \u201csibling\u201d lineages that cooperate\u2014so the next time your cousin crashes on your couch, call it evolutionary strategy.\n\n*Stress looks the same on everyone*  \nWhen life gets spicy, our bodies flip the same ancient switch. *Cortisol floods fish, birds, and humans alike*, making hearts race and muscles twitch. Zebra finches lose their appetite during tough times, and stressed-out bees become pessimistic (yes, they can test bee mood). So if you\u2019re doom-scrolling at 2 a.m., know that a stressed squirrel in your backyard totally gets you.\n\n*Play isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s homework for life*  \nOtters juggle rocks, dogs zoom in circles, and young ravens snowboard down snowy roofs using jar lids. *Play builds brains and social skills across the board*. Researchers have spotted reptiles \u201cwrestling\u201d for fun and octopuses repeatedly bouncing Lego blocks like toddlers. If it has neurons, it probably needs recess.\n\nNext time you feel alone in the universe, remember that somewhere a parrot is probably preening its best friend, a bat is sharing food with a hungry roost-mate, and a tiny nematode is curling up for a nap. We\u2019re all just variations on a very old, very shared theme."}], "input_metadata": {"row_id": "1646", "completion_params": {"model": "fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096}, "session_data": {"mode": "pointwise"}}, "rollout_status": {"status": "finished"}, "invocation_id": "invent-must-suppose-available-student", "cohort_id": "buy-assume-available-various-point", "rollout_id": "let-safe-magazine-government-adventure", "run_id": "review-hard-single-newspaper-team", "ground_truth": "5", "evaluation_result": {"score": 1.0, "is_score_valid": true, "reason": "\u2705 Found 10 highlighted sections (required: 5)", "metrics": {}}, "created_at": "2025-08-10T16:32:47.176407", "eval_metadata": {"name": "test_markdown_highlighting_evaluation", "description": "\n    Evaluation function that checks if the model's response contains the required number of formatted sections.\n    ", "version": "v0.2.6-dev1.dev6+gc436eaf.dirty", "status": "finished", "num_runs": 1, "aggregation_method": "mean", "threshold_of_success": 0.5, "passed": true}, "pid": 67676}

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 10 Surprising Facts About the Dutch Language That Will Make You Say \u201cWauw!\u201d\n\nIf you think Dutch is just \u201cGerman with a sore throat,\u201d think again. From tongue-twisting consonant clusters to words that sound like they were invented by a stand-up comedian, Dutch is a linguistic playground. Below are ten facts that prove the language is far more colorful than its reputation for windmills and wooden shoes.\n\n---\n\n### 1. *The longest word in Dutch is 53 letters long*  \nMeet **\u201ckindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedenplan\u201d**\u2014a single noun describing the preparation work for a children\u2019s carnival parade. Dutch loves to glue words together, so once you master the basics you can create your own kilometer-long compounds on the fly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dutch has three genders, but only two articles  \nGrammatically, nouns are masculine, feminine, or neuter. In everyday speech, however, masculine and feminine collapsed into a single \u201ccommon\u201d gender, leaving *\u201cde\u201d* for common and *\u201chet\u201d* for neuter. The result? A never-ending guessing game for learners.\n\n---\n\n### 3. *The Dutch alphabet ends with \u201cij,\u201d not \u201cz\u201d*  \nSchoolchildren recite the ABC and finish with \u201c\u2026x, y, ij, z.\u201d The digraph *ij* is so common (think *hij* = he, *mijn* = my) that it\u2019s treated almost like a separate letter. On old typewriters, *ij* even had its own key.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dutch is the closest major language to English  \nFrisian is technically closer, but among languages with tens of millions of speakers, Dutch wins. Compare:  \n- English *\u201cbread\u201d* \u2192 Dutch *\u201cbrood\u201d*  \n- English *\u201cgreen\u201d* \u2192 Dutch *\u201cgroen\u201d*  \nShared roots mean you can read simple Dutch signs long before you\u2019ve cracked a single grammar book.\n\n---\n\n### 5. *Dutch gave New York its first words*  \nBefore it was New York, it was New Amsterdam. That\u2019s why we say *\u201ccookie\u201d* (from Dutch *koekje*) instead of *\u201cbiscuit,\u201d* and *\u201cboss\u201d* (from *baas*) instead of *\u201cmaster.\u201d* Wall Street? It once ran alongside the *\u201cwal\u201d* (rampart) of the city wall.\n\n---\n\n### 6. The word *\u201cgezellig\u201d* has no exact English translation*  \nRoughly it means \u201ccozy,\u201d \u201cconvivial,\u201d or \u201cthe warm feeling of being with friends,\u201d but none of those capture the full vibe. A caf\u00e9 can be *gezellig*, a conversation can be *gezellig*, even a spreadsheet can be *gezellig* if the team is laughing.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Dutch spelling changed overnight in 1996  \nThe *\u201cGroene Boekje\u201d* (Green Booklet) reforms simplified thousands of words. *\u201cpotatos\u201d* became *\u201caardappelen\u201d* and *\u201ccat\u2019s\u201d* became *\u201ckatten.\u201d* Overnight, every dictionary, street sign, and Scrabble board in the country was technically out of date.\n\n---\n\n### 8. *Dutch is spoken on six continents*  \nBesides the Netherlands and Belgium, it\u2019s an official language in Suriname, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten. Thanks to emigration, you\u2019ll also find active Dutch-speaking communities in Canada, Australia, Argentina\u2014even South Africa, where Afrikaans is a daughter language.\n\n---\n\n### 9. The Dutch love diminutives  \nAdd *-je* to almost any noun and you instantly shrink it: *\u201chuis\u201d* (house) \u2192 *\u201chuisje\u201d* (little house). It\u2019s not just about size; diminutives add affection. A *\u201cbiertje\u201d* isn\u2019t a small beer\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to relax.\n\n---\n\n### 10. *Dutch is the language of the world\u2019s oldest multinational*  \nThe Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) was founded in 1602 and issued the planet\u2019s first publicly traded stock. Its ledgers, contracts, and ship logs were all written in Dutch, making the language the original tongue of global capitalism.\n\n---\n\nReady to dive in?

Grab a coffee and let\u2019s talk about something that always blows my mind: *how much we all have in common, even when we look nothing alike*. I was scrolling through wildlife photos the other night and realized that a jellyfish and I are basically running the same basic software\u2014just with different packaging. So here\u2019s a laid-back tour of five \u201cwait, we do that too?!\u201d moments across the animal kingdom.\n\n*We all need our beauty sleep*  \nTurns out, every animal with a nervous system\u2014from fruit flies to blue whales\u2014shares a version of sleep. Crows nap on tree branches, octopuses snooze in coconut-shell beds, and even roundworms have \u201clethargus,\u201d which is basically worm REM. Scientists think sleep is so ancient that the last common ancestor of all animals already had it. So next time you hit snooze, remember you\u2019re honoring a 700-million-year-old tradition.\n\n*Love songs come in many dialects*  \nWhether you\u2019re a human humming in the shower or a humpback whale belting out 30-minute ballads, *we all use rhythm and pitch to flirt and bond*. Frogs croak in choruses, nightingales remix their playlists nightly, and male mice sing ultrasonic \u201cpickup lines\u201d too high for us to hear. Same goal, different instruments.\n\n*Grandma knew best: family matters*  \nElephants babysit their nieces, wolves bring back take-out for auntie, and *clownfish dads are the ultimate stay-at-home fathers*. Across species, kinship networks boost survival. Even bacteria split into \u201csibling\u201d lineages that cooperate\u2014so the next time your cousin crashes on your couch, call it evolutionary strategy.\n\n*Stress looks the same on everyone*  \nWhen life gets spicy, our bodies flip the same ancient switch. *Cortisol floods fish, birds, and humans alike*, making hearts race and muscles twitch. Zebra finches lose their appetite during tough times, and stressed-out bees become pessimistic (yes, they can test bee mood). So if you\u2019re doom-scrolling at 2 a.m., know that a stressed squirrel in your backyard totally gets you.\n\n*Play isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s homework for life*  \nOtters juggle rocks, dogs zoom in circles, and young ravens snowboard down snowy roofs using jar lids. *Play builds brains and social skills across the board*. Researchers have spotted reptiles \u201cwrestling\u201d for fun and octopuses repeatedly bouncing Lego blocks like toddlers. If it has neurons, it probably needs recess.\n\nNext time you feel alone in the universe, remember that somewhere a parrot is probably preening its best friend, a bat is sharing food with a hungry roost-mate, and a tiny nematode is curling up for a nap. We\u2019re all just variations on a very old, very shared theme."}], "input_metadata": {"row_id": "1646", "completion_params": {"model": "fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096}, "session_data": {"mode": "pointwise"}}, "rollout_status": {"status": "finished"}, "invocation_id": "consider-control-similar-president-question", "cohort_id": "build-gentle-story-radio-hate", "rollout_id": "know-slow-gentle-business-family", "run_id": "will-democratic-political-letter-wish", "ground_truth": "5", "evaluation_result": {"score": 1.0, "is_score_valid": true, "reason": "\u2705 Found 10 highlighted sections (required: 5)", "metrics": {}}, "created_at": "2025-08-10T16:37:23.309911", "eval_metadata": {"name": "test_markdown_highlighting_evaluation", "description": "\n    Evaluation function that checks if the model's response contains the required number of formatted sections.\n    ", "version": "v0.2.6-dev1.dev6+gc436eaf.dirty", "status": "finished", "num_runs": 1, "aggregation_method": "mean", "threshold_of_success": 0.5, "passed": true}, "pid": 69623}

Our mission is to become the city\u2019s first climate-positive apparel label, producing 25,000 sweatshirts annually from 100 % recycled or organic fibers, sold through a hybrid D2C e-commerce platform and two flagship stores (Schnoor & Viertel). We target conscious millennials and Gen-Z consumers (18-35) across Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux, projecting \u20ac2.4 M revenue and \u20ac480 k EBITDA by Year 3. Initial capital requirement: \u20ac350 k (40 % founder equity, 35 % green-tech grants, 25 % silent partners). Competitive edge: Bremen-exclusive designs, closed-loop recycling program, and blockchain-verified supply chain transparency.\n\n*Market Analysis*\n\nBremen\u2019s apparel market is valued at \u20ac310 M (Statista 2023), with streetwear growing 8 % YoY. Surveys (n = 1,200) reveal 64 % of local students/professionals willing to pay 15-20 % more for locally-made sustainable sweatshirts. Competitor scan: global fast-fashion lacks traceability; niche German labels (e.g., Armedangels) are not Bremen-focused. Opportunity: fill the \u201clocal pride + sustainability\u201d gap. Online search volume for \u201cBremen hoodie\u201d rose 42 % post-pandemic. Export potential: Hamburg, Copenhagen and Amsterdam show similar demand patterns.\n\n*Product & Sustainability Strategy*\n\nCore line: unisex mid-weight (320 gsm) brushed-fleece sweatshirts in 8 colorways inspired by Bremen\u2019s Hanseatic palette (Weser-sand, Harbor-navy, Speicher-red). Features: raglan sleeves, recycled-polyester thread, nickel-free metal eyelets, QR-coded NFC tag linking to product passport. Circular model: take-back bins in stores; worn items shredded and respun into new yarn at our partner facility in Delmenhorst, achieving 85 % material recapture. Certifications: GOTS, Fair Wear, ClimatePartner. Packaging: algae-based mailers, zero plastic. Launch capsule: 3 graphic drops/year tied to Bremen events (Freimarkt, Schlachte-Zauber, Christmas market).\n\n*Go-to-Market & Sales Channels*\n\nPhase 1 (Months 1-6): Pop-up container store at \u00dcberseestadt container village + Instagram/TikTok teaser campaigns (#BremenHoodieChallenge). Phase 2: Flagship store (Schnoor, 60 m\u00b2) with AR mirror for virtual try-on; second store (Viertel) Year 2. E-commerce: Shopify Plus storefront with carbon-offset checkout plugin. Wholesale: curated selection in 12 concept stores across Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin. Collaborations: limited-edition prints with local street artists and Werder Bremen fan club. Influencer seeding: 50 micro-creators (5-50 k followers) receive personalized sweatshirts. KPIs: CAC \u2264 \u20ac18, online conversion \u2265 3.5 %, repeat purchase rate \u2265 35 %.\n\n*Operations & Financial Plan*\n\nManufacturing: cut-and-sew partner in Gda\u0144sk (Poland) 180 km away, audited for fair labor; MOQ 500 pcs/style.

As a lifelong resident of **[City/County]**, I have watched our community\u2019s political pulse beat strongest when neighbors gather in common purpose. I want to channel that energy into rallies that not only energize our base but also invite undecided voters to witness the power of our shared vision.\n\n### **Proven Event-Execution Expertise**\nDuring the 2022 mid-term cycle, I spearheaded a **three-county voter-registration caravan** that staged 14 pop-up events in 30 days.  \n- **Logistics**: Coordinated permits, portable stages, and ADA-compliant access for 2,000+ attendees per stop.  \n- **Volunteer Mobilization**: Recruited and trained 120 volunteers, creating a color-coded \u201cRally-in-a-Box\u201d toolkit now used by three neighboring county parties.  \n- **Real-Time Adaptability**: When a thunderstorm threatened our largest outdoor rally, I pivoted to an indoor gymnasium within 90 minutes\u2014live-streaming the switch to maintain momentum and ultimately exceeding projected turnout by 18 %.\n\n### **Data-Driven Rally Strategy**\nI treat every rally as a **micro-campaign laboratory**.  \n- **Pre-Event Analytics**: I overlay precinct-level voter-file data with heat-mapping tools to select venues within 0.7 miles of our highest \u201cpersuasion index\u201d households.  \n- **On-Site Engagement**: QR-coded wristbands linked to instant sign-up forms increased volunteer recruitment by 34 % compared to clipboard methods.  \n- **Post-Event ROI**: My post-rally surveys (average 42 % response rate) feed a dashboard that tracks pledge-to-action conversion, allowing us to refine messaging within 48 hours.\n\n### **Coalition-Building & Safety Leadership**\nUnderstanding that rallies must feel **safe and inclusive**, I have:  \n- Partnered with local **faith leaders, PTAs, and small-business associations** to co-sponsor events, expanding our demographic reach by 27 %.  \n- Completed **FEMA crowd-management certification** and maintain relationships with county emergency management to ensure rapid-response protocols.  \n- Implemented a **\u201cCommunity Marshals\u201d** program\u2014training 50 volunteer marshals in de-escalation techniques, cutting incident reports to zero across 22 events.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my blend of grassroots passion, logistical precision, and data fluency can help **[Local Party Name]** turn every rally into a springboard for victory in the upcoming cycle. Thank you for considering my application.\n\n**Respectfully,**\n\n[Your Signature (if submitting hard copy)]  \n[Your Printed Name]"}], "input_metadata": {"row_id": "2381", "completion_params": {"model": "fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096}, "session_data": {"mode": "pointwise"}}, "rollout_status": {"status": "finished"}, "invocation_id": "consider-control-similar-president-question", "cohort_id": "build-gentle-story-radio-hate", "rollout_id": "suppose-real-large-moment-network", "run_id": "will-democratic-political-letter-wish", "ground_truth": "3", "evaluation_result": {"score": 1.0, "is_score_valid": true, "reason": "\u2705 Found 23 highlighted sections (required: 3)", "metrics": {}}, "created_at": "2025-08-10T16:37:23.310345", "eval_metadata": {"name": "test_markdown_highlighting_evaluation", "description": "\n    Evaluation function that checks if the model's response contains the required number of formatted sections.\n    ", "version": "v0.2.6-dev1.dev6+gc436eaf.dirty", "status": "finished", "num_runs": 1, "aggregation_method": "mean", "threshold_of_success": 0.5, "passed": true}, "pid": 69623}

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 10 Surprising Facts About the Dutch Language That Will Make You Say \u201cWauw!\u201d\n\nIf you think Dutch is just \u201cGerman with a sore throat,\u201d think again. From tongue-twisting consonant clusters to words that sound like they were invented by a stand-up comedian, Dutch is a linguistic playground. Below are ten facts that prove the language is far more colorful than its reputation for windmills and wooden shoes.\n\n---\n\n### 1. *The longest word in Dutch is 53 letters long*  \nMeet **\u201ckindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedenplan\u201d**\u2014a single noun describing the preparation work for a children\u2019s carnival parade. Dutch loves to glue words together, so once you master the basics you can create your own kilometer-long compounds on the fly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dutch has three genders, but only two articles  \nGrammatically, nouns are masculine, feminine, or neuter. In everyday speech, however, masculine and feminine collapsed into a single \u201ccommon\u201d gender, leaving *\u201cde\u201d* for common and *\u201chet\u201d* for neuter. The result? A never-ending guessing game for learners.\n\n---\n\n### 3. *The Dutch alphabet ends with \u201cij,\u201d not \u201cz\u201d*  \nSchoolchildren recite the ABC and finish with \u201c\u2026x, y, ij, z.\u201d The digraph *ij* is so common (think *hij* = he, *mijn* = my) that it\u2019s treated almost like a separate letter. On old typewriters, *ij* even had its own key.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dutch is the closest major language to English  \nFrisian is technically closer, but among languages with tens of millions of speakers, Dutch wins. Compare:  \n- English *\u201cbread\u201d* \u2192 Dutch *\u201cbrood\u201d*  \n- English *\u201cgreen\u201d* \u2192 Dutch *\u201cgroen\u201d*  \nShared roots mean you can read simple Dutch signs long before you\u2019ve cracked a single grammar book.\n\n---\n\n### 5. *Dutch gave New York its first words*  \nBefore it was New York, it was New Amsterdam. That\u2019s why we say *\u201ccookie\u201d* (from Dutch *koekje*) instead of *\u201cbiscuit,\u201d* and *\u201cboss\u201d* (from *baas*) instead of *\u201cmaster.\u201d* Wall Street? It once ran alongside the *\u201cwal\u201d* (rampart) of the city wall.\n\n---\n\n### 6. The word *\u201cgezellig\u201d* has no exact English translation*  \nRoughly it means \u201ccozy,\u201d \u201cconvivial,\u201d or \u201cthe warm feeling of being with friends,\u201d but none of those capture the full vibe. A caf\u00e9 can be *gezellig*, a conversation can be *gezellig*, even a spreadsheet can be *gezellig* if the team is laughing.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Dutch spelling changed overnight in 1996  \nThe *\u201cGroene Boekje\u201d* (Green Booklet) reforms simplified thousands of words. *\u201cpotatos\u201d* became *\u201caardappelen\u201d* and *\u201ccat\u2019s\u201d* became *\u201ckatten.\u201d* Overnight, every dictionary, street sign, and Scrabble board in the country was technically out of date.\n\n---\n\n### 8. *Dutch is spoken on six continents*  \nBesides the Netherlands and Belgium, it\u2019s an official language in Suriname, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten. Thanks to emigration, you\u2019ll also find active Dutch-speaking communities in Canada, Australia, Argentina\u2014even South Africa, where Afrikaans is a daughter language.\n\n---\n\n### 9. The Dutch love diminutives  \nAdd *-je* to almost any noun and you instantly shrink it: *\u201chuis\u201d* (house) \u2192 *\u201chuisje\u201d* (little house). It\u2019s not just about size; diminutives add affection. A *\u201cbiertje\u201d* isn\u2019t a small beer\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to relax.\n\n---\n\n### 10. *Dutch is the language of the world\u2019s oldest multinational*  \nThe Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) was founded in 1602 and issued the planet\u2019s first publicly traded stock. Its ledgers, contracts, and ship logs were all written in Dutch, making the language the original tongue of global capitalism.\n\n---\n\nReady to dive in?

From the tiniest ant to the splashiest whale, we keep running into the same life hacks over and over again.

The common thread? Big brains and long childhoods. If you\u2019ve got time to learn, you\u2019ve got time to goof off.\n\n*Grandma knows best*  \nElephant herds led by wizened old matriarchs survive droughts way better than younger crews.

Highlight each section name using the this format:\n*section name*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "*Executive Summary*\nBremen is a city where maritime heritage meets cutting-edge creativity, yet it lacks a locally-rooted premium sweatshirt brand that speaks to both its seafaring soul and its thriving student, start-up, and creative scenes. \u201cBremer Fleece\u201d will fill that gap by producing small-batch, design-forward sweatshirts that celebrate Bremen\u2019s Hanseatic symbols, street-art culture, and eco-conscious values. Our mission is to become the go-to layer for every Bremen resident who wants warmth, style, and a story. We will launch with an initial investment of \u20ac75 k, reach break-even within 18 months, and scale to \u20ac350 k annual revenue by year three.\n\n*Market Analysis*\nBremen & Bremerhaven host 550 k residents, 35 k university students, and 1.2 million annual tourists. Surveys (n = 312) show 68 % of 18-35-year-olds buy at least one sweatshirt per year, yet only 12 % can name a local brand. Competitor mapping reveals three gaps: (1) no Bremen-specific iconography, (2) limited sustainable options, and (3) no on-demand customization. Tourists spend \u20ac45\u2013\u20ac70 on souvenirs; locals spend \u20ac60\u2013\u20ac90 on quality streetwear. By positioning at \u20ac69\u2013\u20ac89 retail, we target both segments without direct price overlap with global fast-fashion or luxury labels.\n\n*Product & Sustainability Strategy*\nAll sweatshirts will be 85 % GOTS-certified organic cotton / 15 % recycled PET fleece, manufactured in Portugal under Fair-Wear audits. Core graphics\u2014designed in collaboration with local illustrators\u2014feature the Bremer Stadtmusikanten silhouette re-imagined in street-art style, the Weser river wave, and subtle maritime signal-flag typography. Each drop is limited to 300 pieces, serialized with NFC tags that unlock AR experiences (e.g., a 3-minute audio tour of the Schlachte promenade). Packaging is plastic-free; returned garments are up-cycled into insulation for Bremen\u2019s social-housing renovations, creating a closed-loop narrative customers can track via QR code.\n\n*Go-to-Market & Sales Channels*\nPhase 1 (Months 1-6): Pop-up store in the Viertel district during \u201cBreminale\u201d festival; online pre-orders via Shopify; collaborations with local craft-beer bars for co-branded nights.  \nPhase 2 (Months 7-12): Permanent micro-store (25 m\u00b2) inside the Waterfront shopping center; integration with local parcel lockers for 24-hour pickup; B2B uniforms for Bremen start-ups (branded left-chest embroidery).  \nPhase 3 (Year 2+): Wholesale to concept stores in Hamburg and Berlin; tourist gift shops at Bremen Airport; subscription \u201cSeasonal Layer\u201d box for expatriates. Marketing mix: Instagram/TikTok reels shot on the Weser riverbanks, micro-influencer contracts (5\u201320 k followers), and a loyalty app awarding \u201cHanseatic Points\u201d redeemable for limited patches.\n\n*Financial Plan & Funding Requirements*\nStart-up capital: \u20ac75 k (founders\u2019 equity \u20ac25 k, silent partner \u20ac30 k, KfW Green Loan \u20ac20 k). Allocation: 40 % inventory, 25 % store fit-out, 15 % marketing, 10 % e-commerce tech, 10 % working capital. Projected Year-1 revenue \u20ac120 k, COGS 35 %, gross margin 65 %, EBITDA \u20ac18 k. Break-even at 1 650 units sold. Year-3 revenue \u20ac350 k, EBITDA \u20ac95 k, valuation multiple 3\u00d7 EBITDA \u2192 potential exit to regional lifestyle group or expansion into Hamburg & Hannover franchises.\n\n*Risk Management & Next Steps*\nKey risks: cotton-price volatility, tourist-season dependency, and IP disputes over street-art collaborations. Mitigation: forward contracts on cotton, dual-season collections (tourist + winter), and written artist agreements with revenue-share clauses. Immediate next steps: finalize supplier MOUs, secure Waterfront lease, launch Kickstarter-style pre-order campaign to validate top three designs, and apply for Bremen \u201c\u00d6ko-Invest\u201d sustainability grant (up to \u20ac10 k non-repayable)."}], "input_metadata": {"row_id": "167", "completion_params": {"model": "fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096}, "session_data": {"mode": "pointwise"}}, "rollout_status": {"status": "finished"}, "invocation_id": "affect-observe-american-event-country", "cohort_id": "read-exploit-spiritual-member-family", "rollout_id": "include-explore-soft-desire-video", "run_id": "represent-soft-ancient-day-force", "ground_truth": "5", "evaluation_result": {"score": 1.0, "is_score_valid": true, "reason": "\u2705 Found 6 highlighted sections (required: 5)", "metrics": {}}, "created_at": "2025-08-10T23:02:31.409388", "eval_metadata": {"name": "test_markdown_highlighting_evaluation", "description": "\n    Evaluation function that checks if the model's response contains the required number of formatted sections.\n    ", "version": "v0.2.6-dev1.dev10+g41c74b6.dirty", "status": "finished", "num_runs": 1, "aggregation_method": "mean", "threshold_of_success": 0.5, "passed": true}, "pid": 12478}

I am eager to channel that same passion into rallies that not only energize our base but also welcome first-time voters who will decide the next decade of policy.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and vision can translate into rallies that move hearts, headlines, and\u2014most importantly\u2014ballots.

Big news! We\u2019ve been assigned to a brand-new host: Chad Thunderbuns, personal trainer and part-time hand-shaker!\u201d\n\nGary\u2019s eyes widened. *Chad Thunderbuns?* The guy who high-fived an entire marathon, then licked his fingers because \u201csalt is electrolytes\u201d? This was the Super Bowl of sniffles.\n\nThey suited up in tiny parkas (viruses hate the cold, irony noted) and parachuted into Chad\u2019s left nostril during a particularly aggressive CrossFit cooldown. Gary landed in a jungle of nose hair so thick it could\u2019ve been a National Geographic special. Rick got tangled in a dangling booger like a bungee jumper without a cord.\n\n\u201cOperation Sneeze-and-Run is a go!\u201d Gary shouted into his walkie-talkie, which was actually a Q-tip he\u2019d stolen from a pediatrician. He and Rick sprinted toward the sinus expressway, dodging cilia like Indiana Jones boulders. Halfway there, Rick slipped on a puddle of eucalyptus oil\u2014Chad had been \u201cdetoxing.\u201d\n\n\u201cRick! You okay?\u201d\n\nRick gave a thumbs-up, then immediately used the same thumb to poke Chad\u2019s hypothalamus. *Boom!* Thermostat cranked to 101\u00b0F. Chad staggered into his kitchen, muttering, \u201cWhy is it suddenly *Antarctica* in my skull?\u201d\n\nGary seized the moment. He commandeered a lymphocyte Uber, shouting, \u201cTo the throat! I\u2019ve got scratchy to do and larynx to wreck!\u201d The Uber driver, a confused white blood cell named Linda, asked, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re supposed to be here?\u201d Gary flashed a fake ID that read \u201cTotally Not a Virus, Honest.\u201d Linda shrugged\u2014she was off duty in ten minutes anyway.\n\nMeanwhile, Chad\u2014now wrapped in seventeen blankets and one questionable Snuggie\u2014googled \u201chow to throw a cold.\u201d The search results were unhelpful: \u201cYou can\u2019t throw a cold, dummy. You can only *catch* it. Try throwing a frisbee instead.\u201d Chad tried anyway, lobbing a box of tissues across the room. It landed on his cat, Mr. Whiskers, who promptly *caught* the box and gave Chad a look that said, \u201cI\u2019m switching owners.\u201d\n\nBack in the nasal trenches, Gary and Rick set up their base camp in a tonsil cave. They hung a banner: \u201cWelcome to Phlegmville\u2014Population: Growing!\u201d Rick coughed up a tiny karaoke machine, and soon the entire throat was rocking to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d performed by the Streptococcus Sisters.\n\nChad, delirious with fever, mistook the music for divine intervention. \u201cThe angels want me to gargle salt water!\u201d he declared, sprinting to the bathroom. Gary panicked. \u201cAbort! Abort! He\u2019s onto us!\u201d But it was too late\u2014Chad gargled so hard he created a tsunami that swept Rick right out the mouth and onto the bathroom mirror. Rick slid down like a sticky snowman, leaving a trail that spelled \u201cWASH YOUR HANDS.\u201d\n\nGary, now the last virus standing, realized he\u2019d caught something himself: loneliness. Also, possibly a conscience. He looked at Chad\u2014shivering, soup-slurping, Googling \u201ccan cats adopt humans\u201d\u2014and sighed. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll downgrade to a 24-hour bug. But only because your Netflix password is \u2018password123\u2019 and I want to finish *Stranger Things*.\u201d\n\nHe radioed HQ: \u201cMission accomplished-ish. Host compromised, but morale low. Requesting extraction and a humidifier.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Chad woke up feeling *almost* human.

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# 7 Surprising Facts About Dutch That Will Make You Say \u201cWat leuk!\u201d\n\nIf you think Dutch is just \u201cGerman with a sore throat,\u201d think again. The language spoken by 25 million people in the Netherlands and northern Belgium is full of quirks, history, and downright delightful oddities. Grab a *stroopwafel* and settle in\u2014here are some of the most interesting facts about Dutch.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Dutch is the closest major language to English\u2014closer than German\nLinguists classify English and Dutch as *West Germanic siblings*. While German diverged early with its case system and umlauts, Dutch and English kept many shared features: similar vocabulary (appel\u2013apple, boek\u2013book), identical word order in many sentences, and even parallel idioms (\u201cIt rains cats and dogs\u201d vs. \u201cHet regent pijpenstelen\u201d). If you\u2019re an English speaker, basic Dutch grammar can feel eerily familiar.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The longest word in Dutch has 60 letters\u2014and yes, it\u2019s official\nMeet *kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedenplan* (\u201cpreparation activities plan for a children\u2019s carnival parade\u201d). It\u2019s in the Van Dale dictionary, so it counts. Dutch loves compound nouns the way English loves hashtags: just keep stacking until you run out of breath.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Dutch has two definite articles\u2014and they\u2019re not interchangeable\nEvery noun is either *de* or *het*. There\u2019s no perfect rule, but 75 % of nouns are *de*-words, and diminutives (ending in \u2011je) are always *het*. Native speakers rarely think about it, but learners create color-coded flashcards and still mess up. Pro tip: if you call the Netherlands *het Nederland*, you\u2019ll get a sympathetic smile and a correction.\n\n---\n\n### 4. The Dutch alphabet gained a 27th letter in 2010\nThe digraph *ij* (pronounced like English \u201ceye\u201d) is so common that phone keyboards in the Netherlands include it as a single key. In crosswords and Scrabble, *ij* counts as one tile, and it even has its own capitalized form: *IJsselmeer*, *IJmuiden*. *Typing \u201cI and J separately feels like writing \u201cNew York\u201d without the space*\u2014technically possible, but why would you?\n\n---\n\n### 5. Dutch once had grammatical gender for tables and chairs\nUntil the 17th century, Dutch had three genders like German: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Over time, masculine and feminine merged into a common gender, leaving only *de* and *het*. Linguists call this process *deflection*, but frustrated students call it \u201cthe reason I cried in Utrecht.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 6. The word \u201cgezellig\u201d has no direct English translation\nAsk ten Dutch people to define *gezellig* and you\u2019ll get ten answers: cozy, convivial, homey, fun, warm, or \u201cthe feeling of being with friends around a fireplace while it snows outside.\u201d The closest English attempt might be \u201chygge,\u201d but that\u2019s Danish. *Gezelligheid* is so central to Dutch culture that the government once used it in tourism ads: \u201cHolland: it\u2019s gezellig.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 7. Dutch is spoken on six continents\u2014yes, including Antarctica\nThanks to the Netherlands\u2019 seafaring history, Dutch left footprints everywhere: Afrikaans in South Africa, *Surinaams-Nederlands* in South America, and even a small Dutch-speaking community in Indonesia. In 1947, Dutch scientists wintering in Antarctica\u2019s *Queen Maud Land* published a bilingual penguin research journal\u2014making Dutch the only language with peer-reviewed articles written on every continent.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: Dutch tongue-twisters are next-level\nTry saying *\u201cDe koetsier poetst de postkoets terwijl de postkoets poest de koetsier\u201d* five times fast. If you succeed, the locals might crown you *konijn van Oranje*\u2014rabbit of Orange, a pun on the royal family. If you fail, you\u2019re still gezellig.\n\n---\n\nWhether you\u2019re planning a canal-side vacation or just binge-watching *Undercover*, Dutch is a language that rewards curiosity. *Dus, tot ziens!*"}], "input_metadata": {"row_id": "3644", "completion_params": {"model": "fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2-instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096}, "session_data": {"mode": "pointwise"}}, "rollout_status": {"status": "finished"}, "invocation_id": "affect-observe-american-event-country", "cohort_id": "read-exploit-spiritual-member-family", "rollout_id": "wonder-visible-entire-military-body", "run_id": "represent-soft-ancient-day-force", "ground_truth": "2", "evaluation_result": {"score": 1.0, "is_score_valid": true, "reason": "\u2705 Found 24 highlighted sections (required: 2)", "metrics": {}}, "created_at": "2025-08-10T23:02:31.410432", "eval_metadata": {"name": "test_markdown_highlighting_evaluation", "description": "\n    Evaluation function that checks if the model's response contains the required number of formatted sections.\n    ", "version": "v0.2.6-dev1.dev10+g41c74b6.dirty", "status": "finished", "num_runs": 1, "aggregation_method": "mean", "threshold_of_success": 0.5, "passed": true}, "pid": 12478}
