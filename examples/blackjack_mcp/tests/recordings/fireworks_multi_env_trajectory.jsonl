The current state is player_sum 13, dealer_card 5, and no usable ace. \n\nFirst, I remember basic Blackjack strategy. When the player has a hard 13 (no ace), and the dealer's upcard is a 5, the dealer is in a weak position. The dealer has to hit until 17, so with a 5, they might bust. But the player's 13 is not great. If the player hits, they risk busting if they get a card higher than 8. But if they stand, they might lose if the dealer ends up with a higher hand.\n\nWait, what's the standard strategy here? Let me think. Basic strategy says to stand on 13 when the dealer's upcard is 2 through 6. Because the dealer is more likely to bust. But wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me recall: for hard totals, if the dealer's upcard is 2-6, you stand on 12 or higher. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if the player has 12, dealer shows 4, you stand. But if the player has 13, dealer's 5, then yes, stand. Because the dealer's chance of busting is higher with a 5. So according to basic strategy, the player should stand here. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think again. If the player has 13, and the dealer has 5, the player's best move is to stand. Because hitting would risk getting a higher card that could bust, and the dealer's 5 is a weak card. So the correct action here would be STAND. \n\nSo the tool call should be to STAND. But wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the exact numbers. The player's sum is 13, dealer's card is 5. The dealer must hit until 17. So the dealer's possible outcomes: if they have a 5 showing, their next card could be a 10 (total 15), then they have to hit again. If they get a 6, that's 11, then hit again. Hmm. The dealer's probability of busting here is decent. But the player's 13 is not a strong hand. But according to basic strategy tables, when the dealer's upcard is 2-6, you stand on 12 or higher. So 13 vs 5, stand. Therefore, the correct move is to STAND.\n</think>\n\n", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_tTPRLpEP0dNh0fwQKw8SaiB7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "blackjack_move", "arguments": "{\"action\": \"STAND\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_tTPRLpEP0dNh0fwQKw8SaiB7", "content": "{\"observation\": \"Error executing tool blackjack_move: Invalid action 'STAND'.
