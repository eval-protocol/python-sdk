Let's map possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move RIGHT first to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT again maybe. Wait, but need to check the grid.\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0)=S, (0,1)=F, (0,2)=H, (0,3)=H. So moving right once is safe, but moving right again to (0,2) would be H, which is bad. So from (0,0), moving RIGHT to (0,1) is safe. Then from (0,1), possible moves: DOWN to (1,1), which is F. Then from (1,1), can move RIGHT to (1,2), which is F. Then from (1,2), moving DOWN to (2,2), which is F. Then from (2,2), moving RIGHT to (2,3), which is F. Then down to (3,3), which is G. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (1,0), which is F. Then right to (1,1), then right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), etc., similar path.\n\nBut need to check if any of these steps hit H. Let's outline the grid:\n\nRow 0: S F H H\nRow 1: F F F H\nRow 2: F H F F\nRow 3: F F F G\n\nSo in row 2, column 1 is H. So if moving down from row 1 to row 2, column 0: (1,0) to (2,0) is F, safe. Then from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is H, which is bad. So need to avoid that.\n\nSo the first move options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf the first move is RIGHT to (0,1), then next move DOWN to (1,1). Then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That path seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if first move is DOWN to (1,0), then RIGHT to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). Also safe.\n\nEither path could work. But the user needs to choose the first move. Since both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but maybe one path is better. Let's check which path has fewer steps. Both paths are similar steps, but the first move could be either. However, in some grid configurations, certain paths might be blocked, but here both seem okay.\n\nThe user's first move should be either RIGHT or DOWN. Which is better? Maybe the DOWN path is more straightforward? Or maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nIf we go RIGHT first:\n\nMove RIGHT to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That's 6 moves.\n\nIf we go DOWN first:\n\nMove DOWN to (1,0), then RIGHT to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). Also 6 moves.\n\nSame number of steps. So either way, it's possible. But the user needs to choose the first action. Since both are safe, perhaps the best first step is to move RIGHT or DOWN. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the DOWN path leads to a shorter path. Let's check the grid again.\n\nFrom (1,0), moving down again would be to row 2, which is F in row 2, column 0. Then from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is H. So must go down to (3,0) then right. Hmm, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,0), moving right to (1,1), then up back to (0,1), but that's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the path moving RIGHT first might be better. Let's see:\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That's a clear path.\n\nSo first move is RIGHT. Let's go with that.

Let's think again.\n\nIf we go RIGHT first:\n\nMove RIGHT to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That's 6 moves.\n\nIf we go DOWN first:\n\nMove DOWN to (1,0), then RIGHT to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). Also 6 moves.\n\nSame number of steps. So either way, it's possible. But the user needs to choose the first action. Since both are safe, perhaps the best first step is to move RIGHT or DOWN. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the DOWN path leads to a shorter path. Let's check the grid again.\n\nFrom (1,0), moving down again would be to row 2, which is F in row 2, column 0. Then from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is H. So must go down to (3,0) then right. Hmm, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,0), moving right to (1,1), then up back to (0,1), but that's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, the path moving RIGHT first might be better. Let's see:\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That's a clear path.\n\nSo first move is RIGHT.

The current grid is shown with the player's position highlighted. The grid starts with S, which is the starting point. The user needs to move to reach G without stepping on H.\n\nLooking at the grid: The initial position is S at (0,0). The grid rows are:\n\nRow 0: S F H H\nRow 1: F F F H\nRow 2: F H F F\nRow 3: F F F G\n\nWait, actually, the grid string is \"\\n\\x1b[41mS\\x1b[0mFHH\\nFFFH\\nFHFF\\nFFFG\\n\". So the first row after the newline is S F H H. Then next rows are F F F H, then F H F F, then F F F G. So the player is at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner.\n\nThe possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP. But since the player is at (0,0), moving UP or LEFT would be invalid (since it's the edge), so they would stay in place. So the valid moves here are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nLooking at the adjacent cells: Moving RIGHT from (0,0) would take to (0,1), which is F (safe). Moving DOWN would take to (1,0), which is F. Both are safe. But need to plan the path towards G.\n\nThe goal is at (3,3). So the player needs to navigate from (0,0) to (3,3). Let's map possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move RIGHT first to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT again maybe. Wait, but need to check the grid.\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0)=S, (0,1)=F, (0,2)=H, (0,3)=H. So moving right once is safe, but moving right again to (0,2) would be H, which is bad. So from (0,0), moving RIGHT to (0,1) is safe. Then from (0,1), possible moves: DOWN to (1,1), which is F. Then from (1,1), can move RIGHT to (1,2), which is F. Then from (1,2), moving DOWN to (2,2), which is F. Then from (2,2), moving RIGHT to (2,3), which is F. Then down to (3,3), which is G. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (1,0), which is F. Then right to (1,1), then right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), etc., similar path.\n\nBut need to check if any of these steps hit H. Let's outline the grid:\n\nRow 0: S F H H\nRow 1: F F F H\nRow 2: F H F F\nRow 3: F F F G\n\nSo in row 2, column 1 is H. So if moving down from row 1 to row 2, column 0: (1,0) to (2,0) is F, safe. Then from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is H, which is bad. So need to avoid that.\n\nSo the first move options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nIf the first move is RIGHT to (0,1), then next move DOWN to (1,1). Then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). That path seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, if first move is DOWN to (1,0), then RIGHT to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3). Also safe.\n\nEither path could work. But the user needs to choose the first move. Since both RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but maybe one path is better. Let's check which path has fewer steps. Both paths are similar steps, but the first move could be either. However, in some grid configurations, certain paths might be blocked, but here both seem okay.\n\nThe user's first move should be either RIGHT or DOWN. Which is better? Maybe the DOWN path is more straightforward? Or maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nIf we go RIGHT first:\n\nMove RIGHT to (0,1), then DOWN to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), then DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3), then DOWN to (3,3).
