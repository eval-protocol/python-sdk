Let me confirm the grid:\n\nRow 0: S H F F  \nRow 1: F F F H  \nRow 2: F F F F  \nRow 3: H F F G  \n\nYes, row 3, column 3 is G. So moving down from current position (row 2, column 3) to row 3, column 3 should be the final step. The cell directly below me is G. So the next action is DOWN.\n</think>\n\n", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_IQ6L6Atyv97FPgXREowz0Ohy", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "lake_move", "arguments": "{\"action\": \"DOWN\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_IQ6L6Atyv97FPgXREowz0Ohy", "content": "{\"position\": 15, \"grid\": \"  (Down)\\nSHFF\\nFFFH\\nFFFF\\nHFF\\u001b[41mG\\u001b[0m\\n\", \"action\": \"DOWN\"}", "metadata": {"reward": 1.0, "terminated": true, "info": {"steps": 0, "tool_call": "lake_move", "arguments": {"action": "DOWN"}, "control_plane": {"reward_source": "control_plane_endpoint", "status_source": "control_plane_endpoint"}}}}]}
