So position 12 is F, 13 F, 14 F, 15 G. So from 8, moving down to 12, then right three times. But how many steps? Let's see:\n\nCurrent position after first move: 4 (row 1, col 0)\nSecond move: DOWN to 8 (row 2, col 0)\nThird move: RIGHT to 9 (row 2, col 1)\nFourth move: RIGHT to 10 (row 2, col 2)\nFifth move: RIGHT to 11 (row 2, col 3)\nSixth move: DOWN to 15 (row 3, col 3) which is G.\n\nAlternatively, from 8, moving DOWN to 12 (row 3, col 0), then RIGHT thrice:\n\nFrom 12, right to 13, then 14, then 15. That's three rights. So moving down to 12, then right three times. But the sixth move would be from 14 to 15. Wait, but the user needs to reach 15. So either path works. Let's stick with the first plan: down to 8, then right thrice, then down. Each step needs to be checked for holes.\n\nBut the user's current position is 4. The next step is to move DOWN to 8. So the next action should be DOWN. Let me check if position 8 is a safe tile. The third row in the original grid was F F F F, so yes, position 8 is F. So moving down again is safe. Then from 8, moving right would be to 9, which is F. So the next action after moving down to 8 would be RIGHT. But the user has to make each move step by step. So the next action is DOWN to 8, then RIGHT, etc.\n\nSo the next step after position 4 is to move DOWN to 8.

Now they're at position 8, which is in the third row, first column.

From position 8 (2,0), moving right three times would take them to 9 (2,1), then 10 (2,2), then 11 (2,3). Then moving down from 11 would land at 15, which is the goal. But wait, the fourth row is FFFG, so positions 12, 13, 14, 15. So moving down from 11 (which is in row 2, column 3) would take them to row 3, column 3, which is G.

Both paths are safe. But the user's current position is 8, so the next move should be right.

The grid is 4x4, and the current position is marked as 'S' in the top-left corner. The grid provided is:\n\nS F F F\nF H F H\nF F F F\nF F F G\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grid string given: '\\n\\x1b[41mS\\x1b[0mFFF\\nFHFH\\nFFFF\\nFFFG\\n'. So breaking it down row by row:\n\nFirst row: S F F F (with S highlighted in red)\nSecond row: F H F H\nThird row: F F F F\nFourth row: F F F G\n\nThe user's current position is at index 0, which is the starting point (0,0) in a 4x4 grid. The goal is to reach G at position (3,3). The holes are at positions (1,1), (1,3), and maybe others? Let me check the grid again.\n\nIn the second row, the string is F H F H, so positions (1,0) is F, (1,1) is H, (1,2) is F, (1,3) is H. Third row is all F's.

But need to plan a path that avoids H. Let's map the positions:\n\nIndices are 0-based, row-major order.

Move RIGHT to 1 (F), then RIGHT to 2 (F), then RIGHT to 3 (F). Then DOWN to 7 (H) which is bad. So that's not good. Alternatively, from row 0, moving down to row 1 at index 4 (F), then from there, move RIGHT to 5 (H) which is bad. So maybe move DOWN again to row 2, index 8 (F), then move RIGHT thrice to reach 11 (F), then DOWN to 15 (G). Wait, row 3 is F F F G. So index 12,13,14,15. So 15 is G.\n\nSo possible path: Start at 0. Move DOWN to 4 (F), then DOWN to 8 (F), then RIGHT to 9 (F), then RIGHT to 10 (F), then RIGHT to 11 (F), then DOWN to 15 (G). That would work. But need to check each step.\n\nAlternatively, another path: Start at 0, move RIGHT to 1 (F), then RIGHT to 2 (F), then DOWN to 6 (F), then RIGHT to 7 (H) which is bad. Hmm, not good.\n\nAnother option: Start at 0, move DOWN to 4 (F), then RIGHT to 5 (H) which is deadly. So that's bad. So moving DOWN from 0 to 4 (F), then DOWN again to 8 (F) would be better. Then from 8, move RIGHT to 9 (F), then RIGHT to 10 (F), RIGHT to 11 (F), then DOWN to 15 (G). That seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, from 0, move RIGHT thrice to reach 3 (F), then DOWN thrice to reach 15. Let's see: 0 \u21921 (F), \u21922 (F), \u21923 (F). Then down to 7 (H) which is bad. So that path is not safe.\n\nSo the first path seems better: 0 \u21924 (DOWN), \u21928 (DOWN), then right thrice to 11, then down to 15.\n\nBut wait, the user's current position is 0. The first move options are to move RIGHT (to 1) or DOWN (to 4). Let's check the grid again. The second row (row 1) is F H F H. So position 4 (row 1, col 0) is F, which is safe.

Then RIGHT to 11 (row 2, col 3), F. Then DOWN to 15 (row 3, col 3), which is G. So that path is safe.\n\nAnother possible path: 0 \u21921 (F), then DOWN to 5 (H) which is bad.
