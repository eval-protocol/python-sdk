When you move to other positions, the hightlighted position will change on the grid. If you step on H, the episode ends with failure.  Use the lake_move tool with actions LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP to navigate the grid."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Initial state"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_123", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "lake_move", "arguments": "{\"action\": \"RIGHT\"}"}}]}]}
