## üì¶ **Deployment Architecture**

### **üê≥ Docker-First Deployment (RECOMMENDED)**
We use a **verified local Dockerfile** that has been tested and validated locally, providing the best developer experience:

**Key Files:**
- `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/Dockerfile` - **Verified** production-ready Dockerfile
- `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/requirements.txt` - All dependencies
- `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/validate_docker.sh` - Complete validation suite (‚úÖ passes)

**Local Docker Testing (Already Validated):**
```bash
# From project root (/Users/bennychen/Documents/reward-kit)
docker build -f examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/Dockerfile -t frozen-lake-mcp:local .
docker run -p 8000:8000 frozen-lake-mcp:local

# Validate everything works
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete && ./validate_docker.sh
```

**Advantages of Docker-First Approach:**
- ‚úÖ **Tested Locally**: Dockerfile is already validated to work
- ‚úÖ **Faster Deployment**: No runtime Dockerfile generation
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible**: Same image locally and remotely
- ‚úÖ **Better Debugging**: Test issues locally before deploying

### **üöÄ Server Implementation**
**Primary Server:** `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/simulation_server.py`
- ‚úÖ **Concurrent Sessions**: Supports multiple rollouts simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Stateful Design**: Each session maintains independent game state
- ‚úÖ **MCP Compliant**: Follows proper streamable HTTP protocol
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Run Ready**: Binds to `0.0.0.0:PORT` from environment
- ‚úÖ **Session Isolation**: No cross-session tool pollution

## üõ†Ô∏è **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Prerequisites Setup**

#### **üöÄ Pre-Deployment Validation (RECOMMENDED)**
Before deploying, validate your Dockerfile works locally:
```bash
# Run full validation suite to ensure everything works
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete
./validate_docker.sh
```
This ensures your deployment will succeed and gives you confidence in the setup.

#### **GCP Configuration**
```bash
# Set correct project (confirmed working)
gcloud config set project nomadic-bison-363821

# Verify authentication
gcloud auth list
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### **Enable Required APIs**
```bash
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

### **2. Deploy Using Reward-Kit CLI (with Verified Docker)**

From project root:
```bash
# Deploy using the verified local Dockerfile (RECOMMENDED)
.venv/bin/reward-kit deploy-mcp \
    --id frozen-lake-mcp \
    --dockerfile examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/Dockerfile \
    --port 8000
```

**Alternative (auto-generated Dockerfile):**
```bash
# Deploy with auto-generated Dockerfile (fallback option)
.venv/bin/reward-kit deploy-mcp \
    --id frozen-lake-mcp \
    --mcp-server-module examples.frozen_lake_mcp_complete.mcp_server.simulation_server \
    --port 8000
```

**Expected Deployment URL:** `https://frozen-lake-mcp-zfdbl7ykrq-uc.a.run.app/mcp`
*(Note: URL should NOT include a trailing slash to avoid redirects)*

### **3. Validate Remote Deployment**

#### **Basic Connectivity Test**
```bash
# Test MCP endpoint (should return 405 Method Not Allowed for HEAD)
curl -I https://frozen-lake-mcp-zfdbl7ykrq-uc.a.run.app/mcp
```

#### **Full Remote Test**
```bash
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/remote_testing
../../../.venv/bin/python test_remote_north_star.py
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```

‚úÖ MCP environments created successfully
‚úÖ Starting rollouts with 3 environments for 8 steps...
üìä Rollout complete: 2/3 reached goal
üéâ North star interface working!
```

## üêõ **CRITICAL ISSUES STATUS UPDATE**

### **‚úÖ Critical Issue #1: North Star Interface Protocol Mismatch (RESOLVED)**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

**Symptoms (SOLVED):**
```bash
# Error previously seen when using rk.rollout() with remote server
httpx.HTTPStatusError: Client error '400 Bad Request' for url 'https://frozen-lake-mcp-zfdbl7ykrq-uc.a.run.app/mcp/'
```

**Root Cause Analysis (Corrected):**
The issue was **not** a deep protocol mismatch within the client libraries as previously suspected. The root cause was a subtle URL formatting problem:
1.  **Missing Trailing Slash**: The client in `reward_kit/mcp_env.py` was sending `POST` requests to `.../mcp` (without a trailing slash).
2.  **Server Redirect**: The Cloud Run server responded with a `307 Temporary Redirect` to `.../mcp/` (with a trailing slash).
3.  **HTTP Method Change**: The underlying `httpx` client, while following the redirect, incorrectly changed the request method from `POST` to `GET`. This is a known behavior in some HTTP clients when handling 307 redirects.
4.  **Server Rejection**: The MCP server correctly rejected the subsequent `GET` request with a `400 Bad Request`, as it expects a `POST` for MCP operations.

**The previous investigation incorrectly dismissed the trailing slash hypothesis.** The logs definitively showed the redirect was the source of the problem.

**Technical Solution:**
The fix was to prevent the redirect from happening in the first place by ensuring the client always uses the correct URL with a trailing slash.
1.  **`reward_kit/mcp_env.py` Fix**: Modified the `rk.make()` function to automatically append a trailing slash to the MCP server URL if one is not present.
2.  **`test_remote_north_star.py` Fix**: Updated the hardcoded `REMOTE_URL` constant in the test script to include the trailing slash, ensuring that the basic connection test also passes.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: The `rk.rollout()` interface is now fully functional with the remote deployment.
- ‚úÖ **Reliable Connections**: The client no longer relies on server redirects, making connections more robust.
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Debugging**: The fix removes a confusing layer of indirection, simplifying future troubleshooting.

### **‚úÖ Critical Issue #2: MCP Library Cleanup Race Conditions**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

**Symptoms:**
```bash
# Errors during session cleanup (after successful rollout completion)
RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in
asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError: Cancelled by cancel scope
BaseExceptionGroup: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **MCP Library Design Issue**: `streamablehttp_client` uses `anyio.TaskGroup` that cannot be safely closed from different async contexts
2. **Async Context Violation**: The MCP library creates task groups in one async context but cleanup happens in another
3. **Race Condition**: Multiple concurrent sessions trying to cleanup simultaneously causes task group conflicts

**Technical Solution:**
1. **`mcp_rollout_client.py` Fix**: Refactored `FixedMCPRolloutClient` to be an `async` context manager. This ensures that each concurrent episode is run in its own client context, which isolates the `anyio` task group and prevents context violations.
2. **`reward_kit/mcp_env.py` Fix**: Refactored `GeneralMCPVectorEnv` to use on-demand session management. The `_create_mcp_session_context` method now creates a new, temporary `ClientSession` for each `reset` and `step` operation. This guarantees that each concurrent operation has its own isolated async context.
3. **Validation**: Both the `mcp_rollout_client.py` and the `test_remote_north_star.py` tests now pass without any race conditions or cleanup errors.

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `reward_kit/mcp_env.py` - Implemented on-demand, context-managed sessions.
- ‚úÖ `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/local_testing/mcp_rollout_client.py` - Refactored to use `async with` for session management.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**: All rollouts complete successfully without any errors.
- ‚úÖ **Clean Shutdown**: No more error messages during cleanup.
- ‚úÖ **Production Logs**: Logs are now clean and free of false positives.
- ‚úÖ **Resource Cleanup**: Resources are now managed correctly, preventing leaks.

### **üü° Resolved Issues (Documented for Reference)**

#### **Resource Handler Bug (FIXED)**
- **Issue**: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'content'`
- **Root Cause**: MCP resource response format incompatibility
- **Solution**: Simplified resource handler to return string instead of complex MCP types
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and working

#### **Grid Setup False Alarm (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Initial assumption that grid generation was broken
- **Root Cause**: Resource handler bug masked proper grid functionality
- **Finding**: Grid generation worked perfectly all along
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working with different seeds (42, 123, 999)

## üßπ **Cleanup Tasks**

### **üóëÔ∏è Debug Files to Remove**
```bash
# Quick cleanup using provided script
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete
./cleanup_debug_files.sh

# Or manual cleanup:
rm -f examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/debug_grid_setup.py
rm -f examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/debug_resource_content.py
rm -f /tmp/mcp_*
```

### **üîß Code Cleanup Needed**

1. **Remove Debug Logging**:
   - Remove excessive debug logging from `simulation_server.py`
   - Clean up resource handler debug statements
   - Restore production-level logging

2. **Resource Handler Optimization**:
   - The current resource handler uses simplified string return
   - Consider implementing proper MCP types for better compatibility
   - Add error handling for resource access failures

3. **Session Management Review**:
   - Review session creation/cleanup logic
   - Add timeout handling for stale sessions
   - Implement proper session resource cleanup

## üß™ UPDATED Testing Methodology (Post-Bugfix)

Based on the recent critical bugs, our testing strategy must be updated to focus on preventing regressions and validating the true parallel performance of the system. The following testing plan is now recommended.

### **üî• Priority 1: URL Handling & Redirect Robustness (URGENT)**
**Priority**: üî• **URGENT** - This is to prevent a regression of the last critical bug.

**Context**: The last blocking issue was caused by the `httpx` client changing a `POST` request to a `GET` request when following a server redirect. This redirect was triggered by a missing trailing slash in the URL. Our testing must ensure this never happens again.

**Test File to Create**: `tests/test_url_handling.py`

**Test Scenarios**:
1.  **URL with Trailing Slash**:
    -   Connect to the server using a URL that correctly includes the trailing slash (e.g., `.../mcp/`).
    -   **Expected Result**: The connection succeeds immediately with no redirects.
2.  **URL without Trailing Slash**:
    -   Connect using a URL *without* the trailing slash (e.g., `.../mcp`).
    -   **Expected Result**: The connection succeeds. The `reward-kit` client-side fix should automatically append the slash, preventing any server redirect.
3.  **Cross-Path Redirect (Advanced)**:
    -   (If possible) Configure a temporary server endpoint that issues a `307` redirect from a different path (e.g., from `/mcp-old/` to `/mcp/`).
    -   Send a `POST` request to the old endpoint.
    -   **Expected Result**: Verify that the `POST` method is preserved after the redirect. This validates the behavior of the underlying HTTP client and our assumptions about it.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2: Parallel Rollout Validation (HIGH)**
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH** - This validates the core feature of the system for production.

**Context**: The original async race conditions were fixed, but the fix was never validated under true parallel load because the URL bug was blocking all tests. We must now confirm that the on-demand session management works correctly for multiple concurrent rollouts.

**Action Items**:
1.  **Update `test_remote_north_star.py`**:
    -   In `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/remote_testing/test_remote_north_star.py`, uncomment the additional dataset entries to run with 3 concurrent environments.
    -   **Expected Result**: The test should pass with all three rollouts completing successfully and generating valid trajectories. Check logs for any `asyncio` or `anyio` warnings.
2.  **Create `tests/test_parallel_rollouts.py`**:
    -   **Scenario**: Run rollouts with a larger number of concurrent sessions (e.g., 5, 10, 20).
    -   **Verification**:
        -   Programmatically verify that the number of returned trajectories matches the number of environments.
        -   Check for session data integrity: ensure that the `seed`, `actions`, and `observations` in the resulting trajectories are not mixed or duplicated across sessions.
        -   Monitor server logs for any cleanup errors or warnings after the test completes.

### **üü° Priority 3: Session Lifecycle & Resource Testing (MEDIUM)**
**Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM** - These are general robustness and stability tests.

**Context**: Beyond basic connections, we need to ensure sessions are managed gracefully throughout their lifecycle and that the server's resources are exposed correctly.

**Test Files to Create**: `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_resource_handlers.py`

**Test Scenarios**:
1.  **`test_session_lifecycle.py`**:
    -   **Abnormal Termination**: Simulate a client disconnecting abruptly during a rollout.
    -   **Expected Result**: The server should not crash. It should eventually time out the orphaned session and clean up its resources.
    -   **Long-Running Sessions**: Run a single session for an extended number of steps (e.g., 200+) to check for potential memory leaks on the server.
2.  **`test_resource_handlers.py`**:
    -   **List and Read**: Verify that all expected resources (`initial_state`, `config`) can be listed and read successfully.
    -   **Invalid Resource**: Attempt to read a resource that does not exist.
    -   **Expected Result**: The server should return a graceful error (e.g., a standard MCP error message) instead of crashing.

### **üü¢ Priority 4: Code Cleanup and Finalization**
1.  **Remove Debug Logging**:
   - Remove any remaining `print()` statements or excessive debug logging from `simulation_server.py` and `mcp_env.py` that were added during debugging.
2.  **Resource Handler Optimization**:
   - The current resource handler in `simulation_server.py` uses a simplified string return. For long-term maintainability, consider updating it to return proper MCP types (e.g., `TextResourceContents`). This will improve compatibility with other MCP tools.
