        "This notebook provides a complete eval harness for comparing models using tau2-bench airline evaluation with proper dataset structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dataset Structure**: Following tau2-bench pattern with separate JSON datasets and markdown system prompts\n",
        "2. **Models**: Configured Claude 3 Opus (AnthropicPolicy) and Kimi K2 (FireworksPolicy)\n",
        "3. **Evaluation**: Used tau2-bench NLAssertionsEvaluator for objective scoring\n",
        "4. **Analysis**: Compared performance across multiple dimensions\n",
        "5. **Sharing**: Prepared results for sharing via `firectl create dataset`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "- **Clean Dataset Structure**: Separate JSON data and markdown prompts like the tau2 examples\n",
        "- **Natural Language Evaluation**: Uses human-readable assertions instead of code-based metrics\n",
        "- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Easy to add more models for comparison\n",
        "- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Performance, accuracy, and efficiency metrics\n",
        "- **Reproducible**: Results can be shared and reproduced via firectl\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "1. Set your API keys as environment variables:\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your-anthropic-key-here\"\n",
        "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-openai-key-here\"\n",
        "   export FIREWORKS_API_KEY=\"your-fireworks-key-here\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "2. Start the tau2 MCP server: `cd examples/tau2_mcp && python server.py --port 8000`\n",
        "3. Run the evaluation cells\n",
        "4. Share results with the community using the provided firectl command\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Results:\n",
        "Based on the tau2-bench framework, we expect Kimi K2 to show higher accuracy on natural language assertion evaluation, demonstrating better adherence to airline policy compliance and customer service protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure mimics the tau2-bench pattern and eliminates the need for manual global variables."
