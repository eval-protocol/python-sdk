# Plan: Simplified, Managed Simulation Server for MCP

## 1. Overview & Goal

The current simulation framework for the Frozen Lake example (`examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/simulation_server.py`) requires developers to manually manage session state, which can be complex.

The goal is to introduce a new, simplified simulation paradigm that improves the developer experience by allowing the use of the production, stateless MCP server (`frozen_lake_mcp_server.py`) directly for rollouts. This is achieved by creating a "meta" simulation server that manages a pool of production server instances.

This plan outlines a **non-destructive, additive approach**. The existing `simulation_server.py` will be preserved as an example of manual session management, while the new, easier-to-use managed server will be offered as an alternative.

## 2. Proposed Architecture

The core of this plan is a new **Managed Simulation Server**. This server's only responsibility is to manage a pool of stateless `frozen_lake_mcp_server.py` instances, proxying requests to them.

```

### Key Advantages:
*   **Simplicity:** Developers only need to write and maintain a single, production-focused MCP server.
*   **Scalability:** The manager can spin up as many instances as needed.
*   **True Isolation:** Each simulation run is completely isolated in its own process, preventing interference.
*   **Realism:** Simulations run against the exact same code as production.

## 3. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Parameterize the Production Server

The production server has been successfully modified to accept a seed parameter.

**Modified File:** `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/frozen_lake_mcp_server.py`

‚úÖ **Changes Made:**
1. Added `--seed` command-line argument in `main()`
2. Modified `FrozenLakeProdServer.__init__(self, seed: int = None)` to accept seed
3. Updated environment initialization to use seed: `self.env.reset(seed=seed)`

**Verification:** Production server now accepts `--seed` parameter and creates reproducible environments.

---

### Phase 2: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Process Manager Creation

Two process managers have been implemented:

**‚úÖ Files Created:**
- `reward_kit/mcp/process_manager.py` - Full conda-based process manager
- `reward_kit/mcp/simple_process_manager.py` - Simplified process manager for testing

**Current Implementation:** Uses `SimpleServerProcessManager` for development/testing
**Future:** Should migrate to `CondaServerProcessManager` for production isolation

---

### Phase 3: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Managed Simulation Server

**‚úÖ File Created:** `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/managed_simulation_server.py`

**‚úÖ Key Features Implemented:**
- Session-based server instance management
- Proper MCP client communication using `streamablehttp_client` and `ClientSession`
- Async context management with `AsyncExitStack`
- Request proxying for both tools and resources
- Automatic server cleanup on session end

---

### Phase 4: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enhanced Test Suite

**‚úÖ File Modified:** `examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/tests/test_record_and_replay_e2e.py`

**‚úÖ Added:**
- `managed_simulation_server` pytest fixture (port 9002)
- `test_managed_simulation_server_record_and_replay()`
- `test_managed_simulation_reproducibility()`
- `test_managed_simulation_process_isolation()`
- `test_managed_simulation_resource_cleanup()`
- Updated `test_server_health_checks()` for all three servers

---

## 4. ‚úÖ COMPLETED CRITICAL ISSUES

### ~~Issue #1: End-to-End Testing Not Working~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

~~**Problem:** Tests timeout during execution, no `managed_simulation_trajectory.jsonl` recorded~~
~~**Root Cause:** Server instance creation hangs, likely in the 5-second sleep in `SimpleServerProcessManager.start_server()`~~

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION:**
1. ‚úÖ Reduced startup sleep and implemented proper health check polling
2. ‚úÖ Added socket-based server readiness checking instead of fixed sleep
3. ‚úÖ Verified end-to-end recording works - `managed_simulation_trajectory.jsonl` is created correctly
4. ‚úÖ Fixed async context management to prevent "cancel scope" errors

### ~~Issue #2: Port Management Needs Improvement~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

~~**Problem:** Dynamic port allocation without cleanup tracking~~

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION:**
1. ‚úÖ **Port Range Management:** Implemented configurable port ranges (default: 10000-11000)
2. ‚úÖ **Port Reuse Detection:** Added tracking and smart allocation avoiding recently-used ports
3. ‚úÖ **Cleanup Verification:** Added `_verify_port_freed()` to ensure ports are actually freed
4. ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring:** Implemented proper process cleanup and zombie detection

### ~~Issue #3: Requirements.txt Not Used~~ ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION:** Added `--use-conda-isolation` flag to switch between process managers:
```python
# Now supports both modes:
if use_conda_isolation:
    self.process_manager = CondaServerProcessManager(...)  # Full isolation
else:
    self.process_manager = SimpleServerProcessManager(...)  # Lightweight testing
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING ISSUE:** Conda isolation may not be properly creating local environments and installing from requirements.txt. Needs verification.

### ~~Issue #4: Async Context Management Edge Cases~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

~~**Problem:** Occasional "cancel scope" errors in MCP client connections~~

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed by creating fresh MCP connections for each request instead of reusing them
2. ‚úÖ Proper async context management with `AsyncExitStack` per request
3. ‚úÖ Added timeout handling for MCP client creation

## 5. üîß NEW CRITICAL ISSUES & NEXT STEPS

### Issue #1: Conda Environment Isolation Not Working Properly ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. Verify that conda environments are actually created with unique names
2. Test that requirements.txt dependencies are installed in isolated environments
3. Add logging to track conda environment creation and dependency installation
4. Add error handling for conda environment creation failures

### Issue #2: MCP Environment Module Too Large ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** `reward_kit/mcp_env.py` has become incredibly long and complex
**Impact:** Hard to maintain, test, and extend

2. **Create proper abstractions** for different MCP transports
3. **Add proper testing** for each component

### Issue #3: JavaScript/NPX Server Support Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** Current process managers only support Python scripts
**Need:** Support for JavaScript-based MCP servers using `npx`

**üî¥ TODO:**
1. **Extend `SimpleServerProcessManager`** to support npx commands:
   ```python
   # Support commands like: npx @your-org/mcp-server --port 8000
   ```
2. **Add JavaScript project detection** (package.json presence)
3. **Handle npm/npx dependency installation** in conda environments
4. **Test with JavaScript MCP servers**

### Issue #4: Limited Transport Protocol Support ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** Currently only supports `streamable-http` transport
**Need:** Support for `stdio` and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transports

**üî¥ TODO:**
1. **Add stdio transport support:**
   - Direct process communication via stdin/stdout
   - No HTTP server required
2. **Add SSE transport support:**
   - Server-Sent Events for real-time communication

## 6. üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### üî• **PRIORITY 1: Verify Conda Isolation**
1. **Test conda environment creation:** Verify `CondaServerProcessManager` creates unique environments
2. **Verify requirements.txt installation:** Check dependencies are actually installed in isolated envs
3. **Add comprehensive logging:** Track conda commands and their success/failure
4. **Create integration test:** Test full conda isolation workflow end-to-end

#### Example Test Approach:
```bash
# Test conda isolation manually:
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server
python managed_simulation_server.py --port 9003 --use-conda-isolation --verbose

# Should see logs like:
# INFO: Creating conda environment 'mcp-sim-env-abc123'...
# INFO: Environment 'mcp-sim-env-abc123' created and dependencies installed.
```

### üî• **PRIORITY 2: Refactor MCP Environment Module**
1. **Audit `reward_kit/mcp_env.py`:** Identify logical components and responsibilities
2. **Create component modules:**
   ```
   reward_kit/mcp/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connection.py     # MCP client connection management
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transport.py      # Transport abstractions
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ policy.py         # Policy execution and tool calling

   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manager.py        # Session and environment management
   ```
3. **Maintain backward compatibility:** Keep existing `mcp_env.py` as a facade
4. **Add component-level tests:** Test each component independently

### üî• **PRIORITY 3: Add JavaScript/NPX Support**
1. **Extend process managers** to detect and handle JavaScript projects:
   ```python
   # Auto-detect project type
   if os.path.exists("package.json"):
       return "javascript"
   elif script_path.endswith(".py"):
       return "python"
   ```
2. **Add NPX command support:**
   ```python
   # Support commands like:
   cmd = ["npx", "@your-org/mcp-server", "--port", str(port)]
   ```
3. **Handle npm dependency installation** in conda environments
4. **Test with real JavaScript MCP server**

### üî• **PRIORITY 4: Multi-Transport Support**
1. **Abstract transport layer:**
   ```python
   class TransportManager:
       def create_client(self, transport_type: str, connection_info: dict):
           if transport_type == "streamable-http":
               return StreamableHttpClient(...)
           elif transport_type == "stdio":
               return StdioClient(...)
           elif transport_type == "sse":
               return SSEClient(...)
   ```
2. **Add stdio transport** for direct process communication
3. **Add SSE transport** for real-time server events
4. **Update managed simulation server** to support transport selection

### üî• **PRIORITY 5: Production Monitoring & Health**
1. **Add health check endpoint:** `GET /health` for managed server status
2. **Implement metrics collection:** Track server count, port usage, error rates
3. **Add structured logging:** JSON logs with correlation IDs
4. **Create monitoring dashboard:** Basic web UI showing server pool status

## 8. üìö KEY LEARNINGS & IMPLEMENTATION INSIGHTS

### Critical Technical Learnings:
1. **Async Context Management is Critical:**
   - ‚ùå **Don't reuse MCP clients across async tasks** - causes "cancel scope in different task" errors
   - ‚úÖ **Create fresh MCP connections per request** using `AsyncExitStack` per request
   - ‚úÖ **Use proper async context management** with `streamablehttp_client` + `ClientSession`

2. **Health Checks Must Be Non-Blocking:**
   - ‚ùå **Don't use fixed `time.sleep(5)` for server startup** - causes test timeouts
   - ‚úÖ **Use socket-based polling with timeout** for server readiness
   - ‚úÖ **Add proper health check retry logic** with exponential backoff

3. **Port Management Requires Careful Design:**
   - ‚ùå **Random port allocation without tracking** leads to conflicts and exhaustion
   - ‚úÖ **Use configurable port ranges** (e.g., 10000-11000) with tracking
   - ‚úÖ **Verify ports are actually freed** using socket binding tests

### Architecture Insights:
1. **Dual Process Manager Strategy Works Well:**
   - `SimpleServerProcessManager` for fast development/testing
   - `CondaServerProcessManager` for production isolation
   - Runtime selection via `--use-conda-isolation` flag

2. **Fresh Connections > Connection Pooling:**
   - MCP client reuse across async contexts is error-prone
   - Fresh connections per request are more reliable but slightly slower
   - Acceptable trade-off for stability

3. **Zero Game Logic in Managed Server:**
   - Managed server is pure proxy - delegates everything to production servers
   - This ensures simulation fidelity and reduces duplication

### Development Process Learnings:
1. **Start Simple, Add Complexity Gradually:**
   - SimpleServerProcessManager first, then conda isolation
   - Basic port allocation first, then sophisticated tracking
   - Socket health checks first, then MCP-specific checks

2. **Debugging Async Issues Requires Systematic Approach:**
   - Add extensive logging at each async boundary
   - Use timeout-based testing to identify hangs
   - Test async context cleanup explicitly

3. **Production vs Testing Requirements Differ:**
   - Testing needs fast startup (< 2 seconds)
   - Production needs isolation and reliability
   - Design for both use cases from the start
