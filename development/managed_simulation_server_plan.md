# Plan: Simplified, Managed Simulation Server for MCP

## 1. Overview & Goal

The current simulation framework for the Frozen Lake example (`examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server/simulation_server.py`) requires developers to manually manage session state, which can be complex.

The goal is to introduce a new, simplified simulation paradigm that improves the developer experience by allowing the use of the production, stateless MCP server (`frozen_lake_mcp_server.py`) directly for rollouts. This is achieved by creating a "meta" simulation server that manages a pool of production server instances.

This plan outlines a **non-destructive, additive approach**. The existing `simulation_server.py` will be preserved as an example of manual session management, while the new, easier-to-use managed server will be offered as an alternative.

## 2. Proposed Architecture

The core of this plan is a new **Managed Simulation Server**. This server's only responsibility is to manage a pool of stateless `frozen_lake_mcp_server.py` instances, proxying requests to them.

        P2["Process: frozen_lake_mcp_server.py<br>port: dynamic, seed: 2"]
        PN[...]
    end

    D -- "Forward to correct port" --> P1
    D -- "Forward to correct port" --> P2
    D -- "Forward to correct port" --> PN
```

### Key Advantages:
*   **Simplicity:** Developers only need to write and maintain a single, production-focused MCP server.
*   **Scalability:** The manager can spin up as many instances as needed.
*   **True Isolation:** Each simulation run is completely isolated in its own process, preventing interference.
*   **Realism:** Simulations run against the exact same code as production.

### Issue #3: JavaScript/NPX Server Support Missing ⚠️

**Problem:** Current process managers only support Python scripts
**Need:** Support for JavaScript-based MCP servers using `npx`

## 6. 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 1: Multi-Modal OpenAI Integration (READY TO IMPLEMENT)**

**🎯 Status: Ready for Implementation - Foundation Complete**

With the MCP environment module refactoring complete, OpenAI integration is now straightforward:

1. **Implement OpenAI Policy Class:** Extend `LLMBasePolicy` to create `OpenAIPolicy`
2. **Add Vision Support:** Enable processing of base64-encoded images in prompts
3. **Test with Lunar Lander:** End-to-end rollouts with visual frame analysis
4. **Performance Analysis:** Compare text-only vs. vision-enabled policies

#### Implementation Made Simple:
```python
# The LLMBasePolicy foundation makes this trivial:
class OpenAIPolicy(LLMBasePolicy):
    async def _make_llm_call(self, messages: List[Dict], tools: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        # OpenAI API call with vision support for base64 images

    def _convert_mcp_tools_to_llm_format(self, mcp_tools: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
        # Same as Fireworks - both use OpenAI format
```

#### Example Usage:
```bash
# Test multi-modal OpenAI rollouts with lunar lander
cd examples/lunar_lander_mcp
python test_openai_multimodal.py

# Expected outcome:
# - OpenAI model receives rendered frames as images
# - Makes decisions based on visual state
# - Generates trajectory data with visual context
```

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 2: Verify Conda Isolation**
1. **Test conda environment creation:** Verify `CondaServerProcessManager` creates unique environments
2. **Verify requirements.txt installation:** Check dependencies are actually installed in isolated envs
3. **Add comprehensive logging:** Track conda commands and their success/failure
4. **Create integration test:** Test full conda isolation workflow end-to-end

#### Example Test Approach:
```bash
# Test conda isolation manually:
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp_complete/mcp_server
python managed_simulation_server.py --port 9003 --use-conda-isolation --verbose

# Should see logs like:
# INFO: Creating conda environment 'mcp-sim-env-abc123'...
# INFO: Environment 'mcp-sim-env-abc123' created and dependencies installed.
```

# New OpenAI policy class
policy = rk.OpenAIPolicy(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    temperature=0.2,
)

# Test with lunar lander
envs = rk.make("http://localhost:9004/mcp", dataset=lunar_lander_dataset)
trajectories = await rk.rollout(envs, policy=policy, steps=100)
```

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 6: Production Monitoring & Health**
1. **Add health check endpoint:** `GET /health` for managed server status
2. **Implement metrics collection:** Track server count, port usage, error rates
3. **Add structured logging:** JSON logs with correlation IDs
4. **Create monitoring dashboard:** Basic web UI showing server pool status
