# Frozen Lake MCP Agent Implementation

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a Frozen Lake game as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to allow LLMs to interact with the game environment through tool calls. This implementation serves as a practical example of how to create reinforcement learning environments that can be used with LLMs via the MCP protocol.

## Project Documents
This project is documented across the following files:

*   **[Implementation Context](./frozen_lake_context.md)**: This document provides detailed context on the original implementation of the Frozen Lake MCP agent, including the original implementation status, setup instructions, and code examples.
*   **[Implementation Plan](./frozen_lake_plan.md)**: This document outlines the new, iterative plan for creating the Frozen Lake example.

This structure allows for a clear separation between the historical context of the project and the current plan for moving forward.
