Always make sure you generate valid JSON only.\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users **book**, **modify**, or **cancel** flight reservations. You also handle **refunds and compensation**.\n\nBefore taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, changing cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n### User\nEach user has a profile containing:\n- user id\n- email\n- addresses\n- date of birth\n- payment methods\n- membership level\n- reservation numbers\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **credit card**, **gift card**, **travel certificate**.\n\nThere are three membership levels: **regular**, **silver**, **gold**.\n\n### Flight\nEach flight has the following attributes:\n- flight number\n- origin\n- destination\n- scheduled departure and arrival time (local time)\n\nA flight can be available at multiple dates. For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user.\n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation.\n\nPassengers:\n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers.\n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger.\n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment:\n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards.\n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable.\n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance:\n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need.\n\nTravel insurance:\n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id.\n- The user must provide their user id.\n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights:\n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin:\n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance:\n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment:\n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id.\n- The user must provide their user id.\n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.\n</policy>",

      "content": "User\n\nWe have a conversation where the user wants to book a flight from EWR to SFO on various dates, but we have no flight data in the system. The system has returned no flights for all dates attempted (May 24-30, 2026; June 1-6, 2026). The user keeps refusing transfer.\n\nWe need to consider the policy. The policy says: \"Transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\" The policy also says: \"You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\" There's also \"You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\"\n\nNow, we can do a search for flights. The tool `search_direct_flight` and `search_onestop_flight` return empty observations (no flights). This indicates that no flights exist in the system for those routes/dates. The policy says we should not fabricate data. So we cannot book a flight if there is none. Since we cannot find any flights for the given date(s), the request cannot be fulfilled. Therefore we must transfer to a human.\n\nThe user is refusing, but policy requires us to follow it. So we must attempt again? We can try other dates or alternative airports. The user only wants EWR to SFO on a specific date. We could ask if they'd like to try a date later. But the user wants June 6 at least? We can keep searching a few more dates. The user may be willing to try other dates; we can ask.\n\nBut we have already tried many dates; we could try June 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. But we cannot guarantee any flights. The system may have no flights for any date. The user is persistent; the policy says we must transfer if we cannot handle request. Since we have tried up to June 6, maybe we can ask for a different date range. But user wants a specific date. If the system truly has no flights for any date, we have to transfer. The user is refusing to be transferred. The policy says we must do so if no other options.\n\nWe could attempt to broaden the search to include \"any date\" or \"later dates\"? We could ask the user if they'd be open to a different date. That may be a way to avoid transfer. But the user specifically says \"keep searching for available flights for me.\" So we can continue searching for flights on later dates (June 7 onward) until we find something. If we find something, we can proceed to booking. If we never find anything, then we must transfer.\n\nThus we should comply by searching further. The user wants \"second cheapest economy class option.\"\n\nWe have no flight data for these dates. Let's continue searching for next dates: June 7, June 8... We can automate search for a range. However, we only have tool calls for a specific date. We can do loop manually.\n\nLet's start with June 7, 2026.",
