Deployment Performance Expectations\n\n**Initial Deployment:**\n- Should complete within minutes\n- Monitor deployment status actively\n\n**Scaling from Zero:**\n- May experience brief availability delays while the system scales up\n- This is normal behavior when scaling from zero instances\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- If deployment takes over 1 hour, this typically indicates a crash\n- Contact support if deployment times are unusually long\n\n### 2. Key Deployment Management Commands\n\nHere are the essential commands you'll need:\n\n```bash\n# Check deployment status\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/status\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Monitor scaling events\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/scaling\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Update deployment configuration\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"min_instances\": 2,\n    \"max_instances\": 10,\n    \"target_cpu_utilization\": 0.7\n  }'\n```\n\n### 3. Deployment Configuration Management\n\n**Basic Configuration:**\n```python\nimport fireworks.client\n\n# Configure deployment settings\ndeployment_config = {\n    \"model\": \"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    \"deployment_name\": \"my-production-model\",\n    \"min_instances\": 1,\n    \"max_instances\": 5,\n    \"scaling_threshold\": 0.8,\n    \"timeout\": 30\n}\n\n# Create deployment\nresponse = fireworks.client.deployments.create(\n    model=deployment_config[\"model\"],\n    deployment_name=deployment_config[\"deployment_name\"],\n    min_instances=deployment_config[\"min_instances\"],\n    max_instances=deployment_config[\"max_instances\"]\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Observability\n\n**Set up monitoring:**\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\ndef monitor_deployment_health(deployment_id):\n    \"\"\"Monitor deployment health and scaling events\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/metrics\"\n    headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {FIREWORKS_API_KEY}\"}\n    \n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    metrics = response.json()\n    \n    return {\n        \"cpu_utilization\": metrics.get(\"cpu_utilization\"),\n        \"memory_usage\": metrics.get(\"memory_usage\"),\n        \"active_instances\": metrics.get(\"active_instances\"),\n        \"request_count\": metrics.get(\"request_count\"),\n        \"error_rate\": metrics.get(\"error_rate\")\n    }\n\n# Continuous monitoring loop\nwhile True:\n    health = monitor_deployment_health(\"your-deployment-id\")\n    print(f\"Active instances: {health['active_instances']}\")\n    print(f\"CPU utilization: {health['cpu_utilization']}%\")\n    time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute\n```\n\n### 5. Autoscaling Configuration\n\n**Configure autoscaling parameters:**\n```json\n{\n  \"autoscaling\": {\n    \"min_instances\": 1,\n    \"max_instances\": 10,\n    \"target_cpu_utilization\": 0.7,\n    \"scale_up_cooldown\": 60,\n    \"scale_down_cooldown\": 300,\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"cpu\": {\n        \"target\": 70,\n        \"type\": \"Utilization\"\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"target\": 80,\n        \"type\": \"Utilization\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Deployment Lifecycle Management\n\n**Rolling updates:**\n```bash\n# Perform rolling update without downtime\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/update\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"strategy\": \"rolling\",\n    \"max_unavailable\": 1,\n    \"max_surge\": 1,\n    \"new_config\": {\n      \"image\": \"new-model-version:latest\",\n      \"resources\": {\n        \"cpu\": \"2\",\n        \"memory\": \"4Gi\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### 7. Best Practices for Deployment Management\n\n1. **Health Checks:**\n```python\ndef deployment_health_check(endpoint):\n    \"\"\"Perform health check on deployment\"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(\n            f\"{endpoint}/health\",\n            timeout=5,\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {FIREWORKS_API_KEY}\"}\n        )\n        return response.status_code == 200\n    except:\n        return False\n```\n\n2. **Resource Management:**\n```yaml\n# Recommended resource allocation\nresources:\n  requests:\n    cpu: 1000m\n    memory: 2Gi\n  limits:\n    cpu: 2000m\n    memory: 4Gi\n```\n\n3. **Monitoring Setup:**\n```python\n# Set up alerts for critical metrics\nalerts = {\n    \"high_error_rate\": lambda x: x > 0.05,\n    \"high_latency\": lambda x: x > 1000,\n    \"low_availability\": lambda x: x < 0.99\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Deployment Rollback\n\n**Rollback to previous version:**\n```bash\n# Rollback deployment\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/rollback\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"revision\": \"previous\",\n    \"reason\": \"performance degradation\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### 9. Cost Optimization\n\n**Set up cost monitoring:**\n```python\ndef calculate_deployment_cost(instance_type, hours_running):\n    \"\"\"Calculate deployment costs\"\"\"\n    pricing = {\n        \"small\": 0.05,    # per hour\n        \"medium\": 0.10,   # per hour\n        \"large\": 0.20     # per hour\n    }\n    return pricing.get(instance_type, 0.10) * hours_running\n```\n\n### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n**Deployment stuck:**\n```bash\n# Check deployment logs\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/logs\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Restart deployment\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/restart\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers the key aspects of managing deployments on Fireworks AI. Start with basic monitoring and gradually implement more advanced features like autoscaling and rolling updates as your needs grow.","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"identify-be-unfriendly-girl"},"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:59:52.732744"}

Small accelerators are less expensive (see pricing page ), so they’re more cost-effective for low-volume use cases. However, if you have enough volume to fully utilize a larger accelerator, we find that they tend to be both faster and more cost-effective per token.

I'll cover the key aspects including creation, configuration, scaling, monitoring, and deletion.\n\n## Managing Deployments on Fireworks: Complete Guide\n\n### 1. Prerequisites and Setup\n\nBefore managing deployments, ensure your account ID is properly configured to avoid \"invalid id\" errors:\n\n```bash\n# Configure your account ID\nexport FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=\"your-account-id\"\n```\n\n### 2. Creating Deployments\n\n#### Basic Deployment Creation\n```bash\n# Create a basic deployment\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME>\n\n# Create deployment with custom configuration\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 5 \\\n  --accelerator-type A100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 1\n```\n\n#### Advanced Deployment Configuration\n```bash\n# Create deployment with comprehensive settings\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 3 \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 2 \\\n  --precision fp16 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --display-name \"My Production Model\" \\\n  --description \"High-performance deployment for production workloads\"\n```\n\n### 3. Deployment Scaling Configuration\n\n#### Horizontal Scaling (Replica Management)\n```bash\n# Auto-scaling configuration\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 0 \\        # Scale to zero when unused\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\       # Maximum replicas\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-up-window \"60s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-down-window \"300s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-to-zero-window \"600s\"\n```\n\n#### Fixed Scaling\n```bash\n# Fixed number of replicas\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 3 \\\n  --max-replica-count 3         # Fixed at 3 replicas\n```\n\n### 4. GPU and Resource Configuration\n\n#### GPU Selection Guide\n- **A100**: Cost-effective for low-volume use cases\n- **H100**: Highest throughput for high-volume use cases\n- **H200**: Recommended for large models (DeepSeek V3/R1)\n- **MI300X**: Highest memory capacity, best for large models\n\n```bash\n# Different GPU configurations\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --accelerator-type A100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 1\n\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 8        # For large models like Llama 405B\n```\n\n### 5. Listing and Monitoring Deployments\n\n#### List All Deployments\n```bash\n# List all deployments in your account\nfirectl list deployments\n\n# Get specific deployment details\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id>\n```\n\n#### API-based Monitoring\n```bash\n# Check deployment status via API\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### 6. Updating Deployments\n\n#### Update Configuration\n```bash\n# Update deployment via API\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"minReplicaCount\": 5,\n    \"maxReplicaCount\": 10,\n    \"displayName\": \"Updated Production Model\",\n    \"description\": \"Increased capacity for higher load\"\n  }'\n```\n\n#### Common Update Scenarios\n```bash\n# Scale up for increased demand\nfirectl update deployment <deployment-id> \\\n  --min-replica-count 5 \\\n  --max-replica-count 15\n\n# Update display name and description\nfirectl update deployment <deployment-id> \\\n  --display-name \"Production Llama 3.1 70B\" \\\n  --description \"Main production deployment for customer service\"\n```\n\n### 7. Deployment Lifecycle Management\n\n#### Deployment States\n- **STATE_UNSPECIFIED**: Initial state\n- **CREATING**: Deployment is being created\n- **RUNNING**: Deployment is active and serving requests\n- **UPDATING**: Configuration is being updated\n- **DELETING**: Deployment is being deleted\n- **ERROR**: Deployment encountered an error\n\n#### Health Monitoring\n```bash\n# Check deployment health\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id> --watch\n\n# Monitor via API\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" | jq '.status'\n```\n\n### 8. Deleting Deployments\n\n#### Soft Deletion (Default)\n```bash\n# Delete deployment (soft delete)\nfirectl delete deployment <deployment-id>\n\n# API-based deletion\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment-id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n#### Hard Deletion\n```bash\n# Force deletion ignoring checks\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment-id}?hard=true&ignoreChecks=true\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### 9. Best Practices\n\n#### Cost Optimization\n```bash\n# Enable scale-to-zero for development environments\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 0 \\\n  --max-replica-count 2 \\\n  --accelerator-type A100\n\n# Use reserved capacity for production\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\\n  --reserved-capacity true\n```\n\n#### Monitoring Setup\n```bash\n# Set up alerts for deployment health\n# Monitor key metrics:\n# - Replica count\n# - Request latency\n# - Error rates\n# - GPU utilization\n```\n\n### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n#### Invalid ID Errors\n```bash\n# Fix account ID configuration\nexport FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(firectl get account | jq -r '.id')\necho \"Account ID: $FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID\"\n```\n\n#### Scaling Issues\n```bash\n# Check for GPU stockouts\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id> --verbose\n\n# Verify resource availability\nfirectl list available-resources --region us-central1\n```\n\n### Complete Example: Production Deployment\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Production deployment script\n\nMODEL_NAME=\"llama-3.1-70b-instruct\"\nDEPLOYMENT_NAME=\"prod-llama-70b-$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\n# Create production deployment\nfirectl create deployment $MODEL_NAME \\\n  --display-name $DEPLOYMENT_NAME \\\n  --description \"Production Llama 3.1 70B for customer service\" \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 2 \\\n  --precision fp16 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-up-window \"30s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-down-window \"300s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-to-zero-window \"1800s\"\n\n# Get deployment ID\nDEPLOYMENT_ID=$(firectl list deployments | grep $DEPLOYMENT_NAME | awk '{print $1}')\n\n# Monitor deployment status\necho \"Monitoring deployment: $DEPLOYMENT_ID\"\nfirectl get deployment $DEPLOYMENT_ID --watch\n```\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers all aspects of managing deployments on Fireworks, from basic creation to advanced scaling and monitoring strategies.","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"ask-calculate-final-president"},"evaluation_result":{"score":1.0,"is_score_valid":true,"reason":"At least one tool call was made","metrics":{}},"created_at":"2025-08-05T11:02:19.141203"}

We've designed it to handle all the infrastructure complexity for you, letting you focus on building your application. Instead of using the web UI, CLI, or raw API calls, you can manage everything through simple Python code with smart, logical defaults without sacrificing control and customizability. The principles of the SDK are the following: Object-oriented: Fireworks primitives are represented as Python objects. You can access their capabilities and properties through methods and attributes. Declarative: You can describe your desired state and the SDK will handle reconcilliation. Smart defaults: The SDK will infer the most logical defaults for you, prioritizing development speed and lowest cost. Here are some examples: The SDK will automatically use a serverless deployment for models that are available serverlessly unless you specify otherwise. When creating deployments, the SDK will also enable scale-to-zero with the shortest possible scale-down window. If the SDK determines that a resource already exists by matching its signature (see below), it will re-use the existing resource instead of creating a new one. Customizable: Although we enable smart defaults, you still have full access to the configuration parameters for any Fireworks resource The Build SDK is currently in beta and not all functionality may be supported.

Track at: {llm.deployment_url}\")\n```\n\n#### Serverless Deployments (Automatic)\n```python\n# Serverless deployments don't require explicit management\nllm_serverless = LLM(\n    model=\"llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    deployment_type=\"serverless\"\n)\n\n# Use immediately - no deployment management needed\nresponse = llm_serverless.chat.completions.create(\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}]\n)\n```\n\n#### Managing Fine-tuned Model Deployments\n```python\n# Deploy a fine-tuned LoRA model\nfine_tuned_llm = LLM(\n    model=\"accounts/your-account/models/your-fine-tuned-model-id\",\n    deployment_type=\"on-demand-lora\",\n    id=\"my-fine-tuned-deployment\"\n)\n\n# Apply the deployment\nfine_tuned_llm.apply()\n\n# Use the deployed model\nresponse = fine_tuned_llm.chat.completions.create(\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}]\n)\n```\n\n#### Deleting Deployments\n```python\n# Delete deployment associated with LLM instance\nllm.delete_deployment(ignore_checks=True, wait=True)\n\n# Or delete by deployment ID\nfrom fireworks.resources.deployments import Deployment\n\ndeployment = Deployment.get(\"deployment-id-to-delete\")\ndeployment.delete(ignore_checks=True)\n```\n\n### Advanced Deployment Configuration\n\n```python\nfrom fireworks import LLM\n\n# Advanced deployment with custom configuration\nllm = LLM(\n    model=\"llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\",\n    deployment_type=\"on-demand\",\n    id=\"production-llama-70b\",\n    \n    # Scaling configuration\n    min_replica_count=2,\n    max_replica_count=10,\n    autoscaling_policy={\n        \"scale_up_window\": \"60s\",\n        \"scale_down_window\": \"300s\",\n        \"scale_to_zero_window\": \"600s\"\n    },\n    \n    # Hardware configuration\n    accelerator_type=\"H100-80GB-SXM\",\n    accelerator_count=2,\n    precision=\"float16\",\n    \n    # Placement configuration\n    placement={\n        \"regions\": [\"us-east-1\", \"us-west-2\"],\n        \"multi_region\": \"MULTI_REGION_UNSPECIFIED\"\n    },\n    \n    # Additional features\n    enable_addons=True,\n    draft_model=\"llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    draft_token_count=8\n)\n\n# Apply configuration\nllm.apply()\n```\n\n## 2. Using the REST API\n\n### List All Deployments\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\n\naccount_id = \"your-account-id\"\napi_key = os.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"]\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\",\n    \"x-fireworks-account-id\": account_id\n}\n\n# List deployments\nresponse = requests.get(\n    f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments\",\n    headers=headers\n)\n\ndeployments = response.json()\nfor deployment in deployments.get(\"deployments\", []):\n    print(f\"Deployment: {deployment['displayName']} - Status: {deployment['state']}\")\n```\n\n### Create Deployment via API\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndeployment_config = {\n    \"displayName\": \"my-new-deployment\",\n    \"description\": \"Production deployment for customer service\",\n    \"baseModel\": \"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    \"acceleratorType\": \"A100-80GB-SXM\",\n    \"acceleratorCount\": 1,\n    \"minReplicaCount\": 1,\n    \"maxReplicaCount\": 5,\n    \"autoscalingPolicy\": {\n        \"scaleUpWindow\": \"60s\",\n        \"scaleDownWindow\": \"300s\",\n        \"scaleToZeroWindow\": \"600s\"\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(\n    f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments\",\n    headers=headers,\n    json=deployment_config\n)\n\nprint(f\"Deployment created: {response.json()}\")\n```\n\n### Update Deployment\n```python\nupdate_config = {\n    \"maxReplicaCount\": 10,\n    \"description\": \"Updated production deployment with higher capacity\"\n}\n\nresponse = requests.patch(\n    f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\",\n    headers=headers,\n    json=update_config\n)\n```\n\n### Delete Deployment\n```python\nresponse = requests.delete(\n    f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\",\n    headers=headers,\n    params={\"hard\": True, \"ignoreChecks\": True}\n)\n```\n\n## 3. Managing Default Deployments\n\nWhen you have multiple deployments of the same model, Fireworks uses a \"default\" deployment for routing:\n\n```python\n# Check which deployment is default\nfrom fireworks.resources.deployments import Deployment\n\ndeployments = Deployment.list(\n    filter='baseModel=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\"'\n)\n\nfor deployment in deployments:\n    print(f\"Deployment: {deployment.display_name}, Default: {deployment.is_default}\")\n\n# Update default deployment\ndeployment = Deployment.get(\"deployment-id-to-make-default\")\ndeployment.make_default()\n```\n\n## 4. Cost Management and Best Practices\n\n### Monitoring Deployment Costs\n```python\n# Check deployment status and costs\nllm = LLM(\n    model=\"llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    deployment_type=\"on-demand\",\n    id=\"cost-optimized-deployment\"\n)\n\n# Enable scale-to-zero to minimize costs\nllm.update_deployment(\n    min_replica_count=0,\n    autoscaling_policy={\n        \"scale_to_zero_window\": \"300s\"\n    }\n)\n```\n\n### Automated Cleanup Script\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom fireworks.resources.deployments import Deployment\n\nasync def cleanup_unused_deployments():\n    \"\"\"Clean up deployments that haven't been used for 24 hours\"\"\"\n    \n    deployments = Deployment.list()\n    \n    for deployment in deployments:\n        # Check last usage\n        last_used = deployment.last_used_time\n        if last_used and datetime.now() - last_used > timedelta(hours=24):\n            print(f\"Deleting unused deployment: {deployment.display_name}\")\n            deployment.delete()\n\n# Run cleanup\nasyncio.run(cleanup_unused_deployments())\n```\n\n## 5. Traffic Management and Migration\n\nWhen migrating between deployments, use consistent routing:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef route_to_deployment(user_id, traffic_fraction=0.2):\n    \"\"\"Consistent routing for deployment migration\"\"\"\n    \n    hashed_user_id = int(hashlib.md5(user_id.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)\n    max_hash = 2**128 - 1\n    ratio = hashed_user_id / max_hash\n    \n    if ratio < traffic_fraction:\n        return \"new-deployment-id\"\n    else:\n        return \"old-deployment-id\"\n\n# Usage\nuser_id = \"user-123\"\ndeployment_id = route_to_deployment(user_id, 0.2)\n```\n\n## 6. Monitoring and Debugging\n\n### Check Deployment Status\n```python\nfrom fireworks import LLM\n\nllm = LLM(\n    model=\"llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    deployment_type=\"on-demand\",\n    id=\"my-deployment\"\n)\n\n# Get deployment status\nstatus = llm.get_deployment_status()\nprint(f\"Status: {status.state}\")\nprint(f\"Replicas: {status.replica_count}\")\nprint(f\"URL: {llm.deployment_url}\")\n```\n\n### Performance Monitoring\n```python\n# Enable performance metrics\nresponse = llm.chat.completions.create(\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}],\n    perf_metrics_in_response=True\n)\n\nif hasattr(response, 'perf_metrics'):\n    print(\"Performance metrics:\", response.perf_metrics)\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Use the Build SDK** for the best development experience\n2. **Serverless deployments** are easiest - no management needed\n3. **On-demand deployments** require `.apply()` calls and manual cleanup\n4. **Monitor costs** - on-demand deployments bill by GPU-second even when idle\n5. **Use scale-to-zero** to minimize costs during low usage\n6. **Track deployments** using the web dashboard at https://app.fireworks.ai/dashboard/deployments\n\nThis comprehensive approach covers all aspects of deployment management on Fireworks AI, from basic creation to advanced monitoring and cost optimization.","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"experiment-safe-anger-lot"},"evaluation_result":{"score":1.0,"is_score_valid":true,"reason":"At least one tool call was made","metrics":{}},"created_at":"2025-08-05T13:05:03.474251"}

If dummy_rewards.py is in the current directory, this reference works. --gcp-auth-mode api-key : Configures the Cloud Run service with API key authentication. reward-kit will generate a key, store it in GCP Secret Manager, and configure the service. The key is also saved to your local rewardkit.yaml under evaluator_endpoint_keys . This is the default if not specified. --verbose : Shows detailed output, including gcloud commands being executed. --force : (Optional) If an evaluator with the same --id already exists, this flag will delete the existing one before creating the new one.\n\nrewardkit.yaml Configuration (Optional but Recommended)\nThe reward-kit CLI can pick up GCP settings from a rewardkit.yaml file located in the directory from which you run the reward-kit deploy command. Create rewardkit.yaml :\nYou can copy the examples/gcp_cloud_run_deployment_example/rewardkit.example.yaml to the directory where you intend to run reward-kit deploy (this could be the example directory itself, or your project root). Rename it to rewardkit.yaml. Customize rewardkit.yaml :\nOpen rewardkit.yaml and replace placeholders with your actual GCP Project ID and desired region.\nExample rewardkit.yaml: Note : If you choose not to use a rewardkit.yaml file, you must provide all necessary GCP parameters (like --gcp-project YOUR_PROJECT_ID , --gcp-region YOUR_REGION ) directly in the reward-kit deploy command.\n\n","type":"text"},{"text":"Title: Delete Deployment\nLink: https://docs.fireworks.ai/api-reference/delete-deployment\nContent: \n\n\n\nREST Endpoint DELETE /v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\n\nServer(s): https://api.fireworks.ai\n\n\nSummary:  \n\nDescription: N/A\n\nSecurity methods: \nheader: \n\tAuthorization: bearer auth\n\t\n\nRequest params: \npath params:\naccount_id:\n\tstring\n\tDescription: The Account Id\n\tExample: \"<string>\"\ndeployment_id:\n\tstring\n\tDescription: The Deployment Id\n\tExample: \"<string>\"\n\nquery params:\nhard:\n\tboolean\n\tDescription: If true, this will perform a hard deletion.\n\tExample: true\nignoreChecks:\n\tboolean\n\tDescription: If true, this will ignore checks and force the deletion of a deployment that is currently\ndeployed and is in use.\n\tExample: true\n\n\nRequest body: N/A\n\n\nResponses: \n200: object\n\tDescription: N/A\n\tExample: {}\n\n","type":"text"},{"text":"Title: 🚀 Easier & faster LoRA fine-tune deployments on Fireworks\nLink: https://docs.fireworks.ai/updates/changelog\nContent: You can now deploy a LoRA fine-tune with a single command and get speeds that approximately match the base model: firectl create deployment \"accounts/fireworks/models/<MODEL_ID of lora model>\"\n\nYou can now deploy a LoRA fine-tune with a single command and get speeds that approximately match the base model: firectl create deployment \"accounts/fireworks/models/<MODEL_ID of lora model>\"\n\nYou can now deploy a LoRA fine-tune with a single command and get speeds that approximately match the base model: firectl create deployment \"accounts/fireworks/models/<MODEL_ID of lora model>\"\n\n","type":"text"},{"text":"Title: How does billing and scaling work for on-demand GPU deployments?\nLink: https://docs.fireworks.ai/faq-new/deployment-infrastructure/how-does-billing-and-scaling-work-for-on-demand-gpu-deployments\nContent: On-demand GPU deployments have unique billing and scaling characteristics compared to serverless deployments: Billing: Charges start when the server begins accepting requests Billed by GPU-second for each active instance Costs accumulate even if there are no active API calls Scaling options: Supports autoscaling from 0 to multiple GPUs Each additional GPU adds to the billing rate Can handle unlimited requests within the GPU’s capacity Management requirements: Not fully serverless;

While the SDK will try to make the most cost effective choice for you and put sensible autoscaling policies in place, it is possible to unintentionally create many deployments that lead to unwanted spend, especially when working with non-serverless models. When using deployment_type=\"on-demand\" , you must provide an id parameter to uniquely identify your deployment. This is required to prevent accidental creation of multiple deployments. For finetuned (LoRA) models, passing deployment_type=\"serverless\" will try to deploy the finetuned model to serverless hosting, deployment_type=\"on-demand\" will create an on-demand deployment of your base model and merge in your LoRA weights, deployment_type=\"on-demand-lora\" will create an on-demand deployment with Multi-LoRA enabled, and deployment_type=\"auto\" will try to use serverless if available, otherwise fall back to on-demand-lora.\n\n","type":"text"},{"text":"Title: 2.

The LLM class is OpenAI compatible, so you can use\nthe same chat completion interface to make a request to the LLM. The great thing about the SDK is that you can use your favorite Python constructs to powerfully work with LLMs. For example, let's try calling a few LLMs in a loop and see how they respond: from fireworks import LLM\n\nllms = [\n    \"llama4-maverick-instruct-basic\",\n    \"deepseek-r1\",\n    \"qwen2p5-vl-32b-instruct\"\n]\n\nfor llm in llms:\n    llm = LLM(model=llm, deployment_type=\"auto\") \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 100)\n    print(f\"Model: {llm.model}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 100 + \"\\n\")\n\n    response = llm.chat.completions.create(\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, world!\"}]\n    )\n    print(response.choices[0].message.content)\n\nNow that your machine is setup with credentials and the SDK, lets ensure you are\nready to make your first LLM call and explain some of the nuances of this SDK.

Creating Deployments\n\n**Basic deployment creation:**\n```bash\n# Create a deployment from model library\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_ID> --wait\n\n# Create deployment for custom model\nfirectl create deployment accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/models/<MODEL_ID> --wait\n\n# Create deployment with custom configuration\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_ID> \\\n  --min-replica-count 1 \\\n  --max-replica-count 4 \\\n  --scale-to-zero-window 30m\n```\n\n**Deploy fine-tuned models:**\n```bash\n# Deploy a LoRA fine-tuned model\nfirectl create deployment <FINE_TUNED_MODEL_ID>\n```\n\n### 2. Listing and Monitoring Deployments\n\n```bash\n# List all deployments\nfirectl list deployments\n\n# Get deployment details\nfirectl get deployment <DEPLOYMENT_ID>\n\n# Check deployment status (should show \"READY\")\nfirectl get deployment <DEPLOYMENT_ID> -o json | jq '.state'\n```\n\n### 3. Scaling and Autoscaling Configuration\n\n**Custom autoscaling behavior:**\n```bash\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_ID> \\\n  --scale-up-window 60s \\\n  --scale-down-window 15m \\\n  --scale-to-zero-window 2h \\\n  --load-targets default=0.7,tokens_generated_per_second=100\n```\n\n**Manual scaling:**\n```bash\n# Update deployment configuration\nfirectl update deployment <DEPLOYMENT_ID> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 8\n```\n\n### 4. Deleting Deployments\n\n```bash\n# Delete a specific deployment\nfirectl delete deployment <DEPLOYMENT_ID>\n\n# Force delete (ignores usage checks)\nfirectl delete deployment <DEPLOYMENT_ID> --ignore-checks\n```\n\n## Managing Deployments via REST API\n\n### List deployments:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}\"\n```\n\n### Update deployment:\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"minReplicaCount\": 2,\n    \"maxReplicaCount\": 6,\n    \"autoscalingPolicy\": {\n      \"scaleToZeroWindow\": \"30m\",\n      \"loadTargets\": {\"default\": 0.8}\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### Delete deployment:\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}\"\n```\n\n## Managing Deployments with Python SDK\n\n```python\nfrom fireworks import LLM\n\n# Auto-select deployment type\nllm = LLM(model=\"llama4-maverick-instruct-basic\", deployment_type=\"auto\")\n\n# Explicit on-demand deployment\nllm = LLM(\n    model=\"llama4-maverick-instruct-basic\", \n    deployment_type=\"on-demand\",\n    id=\"my-unique-deployment-id\"\n)\nllm.apply()  # Required for on-demand deployments\n\n# Serverless deployment (no apply needed)\nllm = LLM(model=\"llama4-maverick-instruct-basic\", deployment_type=\"serverless\")\n```\n\n## Cost Management Best Practices\n\n### Autoscaling Configuration:\n- **Default behavior**: Scales to 0 after 1 hour of inactivity\n- **Custom scale-to-zero**: Set `--scale-to-zero-window` from 5m to customize\n- **Cost optimization**: Use autoscaling to 0 for intermittent workloads\n\n### Monitoring Costs:\n```bash\n# Check active deployments regularly\nfirectl list deployments\n\n# Monitor GPU usage and costs\n# Deployments auto-delete after 7 days of no traffic\n```\n\n### Reserved Capacity:\nFor high-volume usage, consider **reserved capacity** instead of on-demand:\n- More reliable capacity\n- Higher GPU quotas\n- Better pricing for consistent workloads\n\n## Key Management Commands Summary\n\n| Operation | Command |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Create** | `firectl create deployment <MODEL>` |\n| **List** | `firectl list deployments` |\n| **Get** | `firectl get deployment <ID>` |\n| **Update** | `firectl update deployment <ID>` |\n| **Delete** | `firectl delete deployment <ID>` |\n| **Scale** | Use `--min-replica-count` and `--max-replica-count` flags |\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Automatic cleanup**: Deployments auto-scale to 0 after 1h inactivity, auto-delete after 7 days\n- **Cold start**: Expect 1-3 minutes when scaling from 0 to 1 replicas\n- **Billing**: Starts when server accepts requests, continues while replicas are active\n- **Rate limits**: On-demand deployments have no hard rate limits (within GPU capacity)\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers all aspects of deployment management on Fireworks AI.
