Deployment Performance Expectations\n\n**Initial Deployment:**\n- Should complete within minutes\n- Monitor deployment status actively\n\n**Scaling from Zero:**\n- May experience brief availability delays while the system scales up\n- This is normal behavior when scaling from zero instances\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- If deployment takes over 1 hour, this typically indicates a crash\n- Contact support if deployment times are unusually long\n\n### 2. Key Deployment Management Commands\n\nHere are the essential commands you'll need:\n\n```bash\n# Check deployment status\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/status\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Monitor scaling events\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/scaling\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Update deployment configuration\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"min_instances\": 2,\n    \"max_instances\": 10,\n    \"target_cpu_utilization\": 0.7\n  }'\n```\n\n### 3. Deployment Configuration Management\n\n**Basic Configuration:**\n```python\nimport fireworks.client\n\n# Configure deployment settings\ndeployment_config = {\n    \"model\": \"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct\",\n    \"deployment_name\": \"my-production-model\",\n    \"min_instances\": 1,\n    \"max_instances\": 5,\n    \"scaling_threshold\": 0.8,\n    \"timeout\": 30\n}\n\n# Create deployment\nresponse = fireworks.client.deployments.create(\n    model=deployment_config[\"model\"],\n    deployment_name=deployment_config[\"deployment_name\"],\n    min_instances=deployment_config[\"min_instances\"],\n    max_instances=deployment_config[\"max_instances\"]\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Observability\n\n**Set up monitoring:**\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\ndef monitor_deployment_health(deployment_id):\n    \"\"\"Monitor deployment health and scaling events\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/metrics\"\n    headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {FIREWORKS_API_KEY}\"}\n    \n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    metrics = response.json()\n    \n    return {\n        \"cpu_utilization\": metrics.get(\"cpu_utilization\"),\n        \"memory_usage\": metrics.get(\"memory_usage\"),\n        \"active_instances\": metrics.get(\"active_instances\"),\n        \"request_count\": metrics.get(\"request_count\"),\n        \"error_rate\": metrics.get(\"error_rate\")\n    }\n\n# Continuous monitoring loop\nwhile True:\n    health = monitor_deployment_health(\"your-deployment-id\")\n    print(f\"Active instances: {health['active_instances']}\")\n    print(f\"CPU utilization: {health['cpu_utilization']}%\")\n    time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute\n```\n\n### 5. Autoscaling Configuration\n\n**Configure autoscaling parameters:**\n```json\n{\n  \"autoscaling\": {\n    \"min_instances\": 1,\n    \"max_instances\": 10,\n    \"target_cpu_utilization\": 0.7,\n    \"scale_up_cooldown\": 60,\n    \"scale_down_cooldown\": 300,\n    \"metrics\": {\n      \"cpu\": {\n        \"target\": 70,\n        \"type\": \"Utilization\"\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"target\": 80,\n        \"type\": \"Utilization\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Deployment Lifecycle Management\n\n**Rolling updates:**\n```bash\n# Perform rolling update without downtime\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/update\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"strategy\": \"rolling\",\n    \"max_unavailable\": 1,\n    \"max_surge\": 1,\n    \"new_config\": {\n      \"image\": \"new-model-version:latest\",\n      \"resources\": {\n        \"cpu\": \"2\",\n        \"memory\": \"4Gi\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### 7. Best Practices for Deployment Management\n\n1. **Health Checks:**\n```python\ndef deployment_health_check(endpoint):\n    \"\"\"Perform health check on deployment\"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(\n            f\"{endpoint}/health\",\n            timeout=5,\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {FIREWORKS_API_KEY}\"}\n        )\n        return response.status_code == 200\n    except:\n        return False\n```\n\n2. **Resource Management:**\n```yaml\n# Recommended resource allocation\nresources:\n  requests:\n    cpu: 1000m\n    memory: 2Gi\n  limits:\n    cpu: 2000m\n    memory: 4Gi\n```\n\n3. **Monitoring Setup:**\n```python\n# Set up alerts for critical metrics\nalerts = {\n    \"high_error_rate\": lambda x: x > 0.05,\n    \"high_latency\": lambda x: x > 1000,\n    \"low_availability\": lambda x: x < 0.99\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Deployment Rollback\n\n**Rollback to previous version:**\n```bash\n# Rollback deployment\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/rollback\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"revision\": \"previous\",\n    \"reason\": \"performance degradation\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### 9. Cost Optimization\n\n**Set up cost monitoring:**\n```python\ndef calculate_deployment_cost(instance_type, hours_running):\n    \"\"\"Calculate deployment costs\"\"\"\n    pricing = {\n        \"small\": 0.05,    # per hour\n        \"medium\": 0.10,   # per hour\n        \"large\": 0.20     # per hour\n    }\n    return pricing.get(instance_type, 0.10) * hours_running\n```\n\n### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n**Deployment stuck:**\n```bash\n# Check deployment logs\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/logs\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n\n# Restart deployment\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/restart\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers the key aspects of managing deployments on Fireworks AI. Start with basic monitoring and gradually implement more advanced features like autoscaling and rolling updates as your needs grow.","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"identify-be-unfriendly-girl"},"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:59:52.732744"}

Fireworks has two grouping of accelerators: smaller (A100) and larger (H100, H200, and MI300X) accelerators. Small accelerators are less expensive (see pricing page ), so they’re more cost-effective for low-volume use cases. However, if you have enough volume to fully utilize a larger accelerator, we find that they tend to be both faster and more cost-effective per token. Choosing between larger accelerators depends on the use case. MI300X has the highest memory capacity and sometimes enables large models to be deployed with comparatively few GPUs. For example, unquantized Llama 3.1 70B fits on one MI300X and FP8 Llama 405B fits on 4 MI300X’s. Higher memory also may enable better throughput for longer prompts and less sharded deployments. It’s also more affordably priced than the H100. H100 offers blazing fast inference and often provides the highest throughput, especially for high-volume use cases H200 is recommended for large models like DeepSeek V3 and DeepSeek R1 e.g. the minimum config for DeepSeek V3, DeepSeek R1 is 8 H200s.\n\nIt depends on your specific needs.

I'll cover the key aspects including creation, configuration, scaling, monitoring, and deletion.\n\n## Managing Deployments on Fireworks: Complete Guide\n\n### 1. Prerequisites and Setup\n\nBefore managing deployments, ensure your account ID is properly configured to avoid \"invalid id\" errors:\n\n```bash\n# Configure your account ID\nexport FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=\"your-account-id\"\n```\n\n### 2. Creating Deployments\n\n#### Basic Deployment Creation\n```bash\n# Create a basic deployment\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME>\n\n# Create deployment with custom configuration\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 5 \\\n  --accelerator-type A100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 1\n```\n\n#### Advanced Deployment Configuration\n```bash\n# Create deployment with comprehensive settings\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 3 \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 2 \\\n  --precision fp16 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --display-name \"My Production Model\" \\\n  --description \"High-performance deployment for production workloads\"\n```\n\n### 3. Deployment Scaling Configuration\n\n#### Horizontal Scaling (Replica Management)\n```bash\n# Auto-scaling configuration\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 0 \\        # Scale to zero when unused\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\       # Maximum replicas\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-up-window \"60s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-down-window \"300s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-to-zero-window \"600s\"\n```\n\n#### Fixed Scaling\n```bash\n# Fixed number of replicas\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 3 \\\n  --max-replica-count 3         # Fixed at 3 replicas\n```\n\n### 4. GPU and Resource Configuration\n\n#### GPU Selection Guide\n- **A100**: Cost-effective for low-volume use cases\n- **H100**: Highest throughput for high-volume use cases\n- **H200**: Recommended for large models (DeepSeek V3/R1)\n- **MI300X**: Highest memory capacity, best for large models\n\n```bash\n# Different GPU configurations\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --accelerator-type A100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 1\n\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 8        # For large models like Llama 405B\n```\n\n### 5. Listing and Monitoring Deployments\n\n#### List All Deployments\n```bash\n# List all deployments in your account\nfirectl list deployments\n\n# Get specific deployment details\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id>\n```\n\n#### API-based Monitoring\n```bash\n# Check deployment status via API\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### 6. Updating Deployments\n\n#### Update Configuration\n```bash\n# Update deployment via API\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"minReplicaCount\": 5,\n    \"maxReplicaCount\": 10,\n    \"displayName\": \"Updated Production Model\",\n    \"description\": \"Increased capacity for higher load\"\n  }'\n```\n\n#### Common Update Scenarios\n```bash\n# Scale up for increased demand\nfirectl update deployment <deployment-id> \\\n  --min-replica-count 5 \\\n  --max-replica-count 15\n\n# Update display name and description\nfirectl update deployment <deployment-id> \\\n  --display-name \"Production Llama 3.1 70B\" \\\n  --description \"Main production deployment for customer service\"\n```\n\n### 7. Deployment Lifecycle Management\n\n#### Deployment States\n- **STATE_UNSPECIFIED**: Initial state\n- **CREATING**: Deployment is being created\n- **RUNNING**: Deployment is active and serving requests\n- **UPDATING**: Configuration is being updated\n- **DELETING**: Deployment is being deleted\n- **ERROR**: Deployment encountered an error\n\n#### Health Monitoring\n```bash\n# Check deployment health\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id> --watch\n\n# Monitor via API\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\" | jq '.status'\n```\n\n### 8. Deleting Deployments\n\n#### Soft Deletion (Default)\n```bash\n# Delete deployment (soft delete)\nfirectl delete deployment <deployment-id>\n\n# API-based deletion\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment-id}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n#### Hard Deletion\n```bash\n# Force deletion ignoring checks\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://api.fireworks.ai/v1/accounts/{account_id}/deployments/{deployment-id}?hard=true&ignoreChecks=true\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n### 9. Best Practices\n\n#### Cost Optimization\n```bash\n# Enable scale-to-zero for development environments\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 0 \\\n  --max-replica-count 2 \\\n  --accelerator-type A100\n\n# Use reserved capacity for production\nfirectl create deployment <MODEL_NAME> \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\\n  --reserved-capacity true\n```\n\n#### Monitoring Setup\n```bash\n# Set up alerts for deployment health\n# Monitor key metrics:\n# - Replica count\n# - Request latency\n# - Error rates\n# - GPU utilization\n```\n\n### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n#### Invalid ID Errors\n```bash\n# Fix account ID configuration\nexport FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(firectl get account | jq -r '.id')\necho \"Account ID: $FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID\"\n```\n\n#### Scaling Issues\n```bash\n# Check for GPU stockouts\nfirectl get deployment <deployment-id> --verbose\n\n# Verify resource availability\nfirectl list available-resources --region us-central1\n```\n\n### Complete Example: Production Deployment\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Production deployment script\n\nMODEL_NAME=\"llama-3.1-70b-instruct\"\nDEPLOYMENT_NAME=\"prod-llama-70b-$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\n# Create production deployment\nfirectl create deployment $MODEL_NAME \\\n  --display-name $DEPLOYMENT_NAME \\\n  --description \"Production Llama 3.1 70B for customer service\" \\\n  --min-replica-count 2 \\\n  --max-replica-count 10 \\\n  --accelerator-type H100 \\\n  --accelerator-count 2 \\\n  --precision fp16 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-up-window \"30s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-down-window \"300s\" \\\n  --autoscaling-policy.scale-to-zero-window \"1800s\"\n\n# Get deployment ID\nDEPLOYMENT_ID=$(firectl list deployments | grep $DEPLOYMENT_NAME | awk '{print $1}')\n\n# Monitor deployment status\necho \"Monitoring deployment: $DEPLOYMENT_ID\"\nfirectl get deployment $DEPLOYMENT_ID --watch\n```\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers all aspects of managing deployments on Fireworks, from basic creation to advanced scaling and monitoring strategies.","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"ask-calculate-final-president"},"evaluation_result":{"score":1.0,"is_score_valid":true,"reason":"At least one tool call was made","metrics":{}},"created_at":"2025-08-05T11:02:19.141203"}
