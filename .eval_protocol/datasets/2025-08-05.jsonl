You can deploy custom models using this command-line interface.\n\n### 3. **Deployment Tools**\n- **firectl**: The primary deployment tool for managing models on Fireworks AI\n- Used for both standard and custom model deployments\n- Supports configuration via YAML files\n\n### 4. **Monitoring and Management**\n- Monitor deployment status regularly\n- Contact support for unusually long deployment times\n- Watch for scaling delays when starting from zero instances\n\n### 5. **Configuration Management**\nDeployments can be configured using YAML configuration files, similar to how fine-tuning jobs are configured.\n\n## Next Steps for Managing Deployments\n\nTo get started with deployment management, you should:\n\n1. **Install firectl**: The Fireworks AI command-line tool\n2. **Prepare your model**: Ensure your model is properly formatted and ready for deployment\n3. **Create deployment configuration**: Use YAML files to define deployment parameters\n4. **Monitor deployment**: Use built-in monitoring tools to track deployment status\n5. **Scale as needed**: Configure auto-scaling based on your traffic patterns\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these deployment management aspects, such as specific firectl commands or configuration examples?","tool_calls":[]}],"input_metadata":{"row_id":"feel-might-gaseous-picture"},"created_at":"2025-08-05T10:43:36.343980"}
